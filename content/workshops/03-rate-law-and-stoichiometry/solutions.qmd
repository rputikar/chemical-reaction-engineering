## P 4-8

The gas-phase reaction

$$
\ce{1/2 N2 + 3/2 H2 -> NH3}
$$

is to be carried out isothermally first in a flow reactor.
The molar feed is 50% $\ce{H2}$ and 50% $\ce{N2}$ , at a pressure of 16.4 atm
and at a temperature of $227 \ ^{\circ}C$?.

(a) Construct a complete stoichiometric table.

(b) Express the concentrations in $mol/dm^3$ of each for the reacting species
    as a function of conversion. Evaluate $C_{A0}$, $\delta$ and $\epsilon$,
    and then calculate the concentrations of ammonia and hydrogen when the
    conversion of $\ce{H2}$ is 60%.

(c) Suppose by chance the reaction is elementary with $k_{N_2} = 40 \ dm^3
    /mol/s$. Write the rate of reaction solely as a function of conversion for

    (1) a flow reactor, and for

    (2) a constant-volume batch reactor.

(a) Write the rate law solely as a function of conversion, numerically
    evaluating all possible symbols.

(b) What is the conversion and rate of reaction when $V=0.2 \ ft^3$ ?

Additional information:

Equal moles of A and B are present at $t_0$

Initial volume: $0.15 \ ft^3$

Value of $k_1 : 1.0 \ (ft^3 /lb mol)^2 \cdot s^{-1}$

The spring constant is such that the relationship between the volume of the
reactor and pressure within the reactor is

$V = (0.1)\ (P)$   (V in $ft^3$ , P in $atm$)

Temperature of system (considered constant): $140 \ ^{\circ}F$

Gas constant: $0.73 \ ft^3 atm/lb mol \cdot ^{\circ}R$

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution

a. Rate law as f(X)

$$
y_{A0} = \frac{N_{A0}}{N_{A0} + N_{B0}} = 0.5
$$

$$ \delta = 8 - 1 - 1 = 6 $$

$$ \epsilon = y_{A0} \delta = 3 $$


$$
V = V_0 (1 + \epsilon X) \frac{P_0}{P} \frac{T}{T_0}
$$

$$ P_0 = 10 V_0; P = 10 V $$

$$
V = \frac{10 V_0^2}{10 V} (1 + \epsilon X)
$$

$$
V^2 = V_0^2 (1 + \epsilon X)
$$

$$
N_A = N_{A0}(1 - X); N_B = N_{A0} (\Theta_B - X)
$$

$$ \Theta_B = \frac{N_{B0}}{N_{A0}} = 1 $$

$$
-r_A = k C_A^2 C_B = \frac{k N_A^2 N_B}{V^2} 
= \frac{k N_{A0}^3 (1-X)^3}{V_0^3 (1 + \epsilon X)^3/2}
$$

$$
\frac{N_{A0}}{V_0} = \frac{y_{A0} P}{RT}
$$

$$
\therefore -r_A = k \left( \frac{y_{A0} P_0}{RT} \right)^3
                    \left( \frac{(1-X)}{(1 + \epsilon X)^{1/2}} \right)^3
$$

$$
-r_A = 5.02 \times 10^{-9} \left( \frac{(1-X)}{(1 + \epsilon X)^{1/2}} \right)^3
$$

b. $X$ and $-r_A$ at $V = 0.2 ft^3$

$$
V^2 = V_0^2 (1 + \epsilon X)
$$

$$
(0.2)^2 = (0.15)^2 (1 + 3 X) \Rightarrow X = 0.259
$$

$$
-r_A = 8.623 \times 10^{-10} lbmol/ft^3 s
$$
