Try following problems from Fogler 5e (@fogler2016)
P 16-3,
P 16-6,
P 16-11

We will go through some of these problems in the workshop.

## P 16-3

Consider the $E(t)$ curve below.

![](../../../assets/images/fig_p16.3.png){width=50%}

Mathematically this hemi circle is described by these equations:

For $2\tau >= t >= 0$, then $E(t) = \sqrt{\tau^2 - (t - \tau)^2}$ min^â€“1^ (hemi circle)

For $t > 2\tau$, then $E(t) = 0$

(a) What is the mean residence time?

(b) What is the variance?

## P 16-6

An RTD experiment was carried out in a nonideal reactor that gave the following results:

|                          |     |                      |
| ------------------------ | --- | -------------------- |
| $E(t) = 0$               | for | $t < 1 \, min$       |
| $E(t) = 1.0 \, min^{-1}$ | for | $1 <= t <= 2 \, min$ |
| $E(t) = 0$               | for | $t > 2 \, min$       |

(a) What are the mean residence time, $t_m$, and variance $\sigma^2$?

(b) What is the fraction of the fluid that spends a time 1.5 minutes or longer in the reactor?

(c) What fraction of fluid spends 2 minutes or less in the reactor?

(d) What fraction of fluid spends between 1.5 and 2 minutes in the reactor?

## P 16-11

The volumetric flow rate through a reactor is 10 dm^3^/min.
A pulse test gave the following concentration measurements at the outlet:

| t (min) | $c \times 10^5$ | t (min) | $c \times 10^5$ |
| ------- | --------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 0       | 0               | 15      | 238             |
| 0.4     | 329             | 20      | 136             |
| 1.0     | 622             | 25      | 77              |
| 2       | 812             | 30      | 44              |
| 3       | 831             | 35      | 25              |
| 4       | 785             | 40      | 14              |
| 5       | 720             | 45      | 8               |
| 6       | 650             | 50      | 5               |
| 8       | 523             | 60      | 1               |
| 10      | 418             |         |                 |

(a) Plot the external-age distribution $E(t)$ as a function of time.

(b) Plot the external-age cumulative distribution $F(t)$ as a function of time.

(c) What are the mean residence time $t_m$ and the variance, $\sigma^2$ ?

(d) What fraction of the material spends between 2 and 4 minutes in the reactor?

(e) What fraction of the material spends longer than 6 minutes in the reactor?

(f) What fraction of the material spends less than 3 minutes in the reactor?

(g) Plot the normalized distributions $E(\Phi)$ and $F(\Phi)$ as a function of $(\Phi)$.

(h) What is the reactor volume?

(i) Plot the internal-age distribution $I(t)$ as a function of time.

(j) What is the mean internal age $\alpha_m$ ?
