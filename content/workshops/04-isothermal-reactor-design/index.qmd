## P 5-7

The gas-phase reaction

$$
\ce{A -> B + C} 
$$

follows an elementary rate law and is to be carried out first in a PFR and then
in a separate experiment in a CSTR. When pure A is fed to a 10 dm^3^ PFR at 300
K and a volumetric flow rate of 5 dm^3^/s, the conversion is 80%. When a
mixture of 50% A and 50% inert (I) is fed to a 10 dm^3^ CSTR at 320 K and a
volumetric flow rate of 5 dm^3^/s, the conversion is also 80%. What is the
activation energy in cal/mol?

## P 5-8

The elementary gas-phase reaction

$$
\ce{A -> B}
$$

takes place isobarically and isothermally in a PFR where 63.2% conversion is
achieved. The feed is pure A.

It is proposed to put a CSTR of equal volume upstream of the PFR. Based on the
entering molar flow rate to A to the first reactor, what will be the
intermediate from the CSTR, X~1~ , and exit conversion from the PFR, X~2~ ,
based on the feed to first reactor?

The entering flow rates and all other variables remain the same as that for the
single PFR.

## P 5-9

The liquid-phase reaction

$$
\ce{A + B -> C}
$$

follows an elementary rate law and is carried out isothermally in a flow system.
The concentrations of the A and B feed streams are 2 M before mixing.
The volumetric flow rate of each stream is 5 dm^3^/min, and the entering temperature is 300 K.
The streams are mixed immediately before entering.
Two reactors are available.
One is a gray, 200.0 dm^3^ CSTR that can be heated to 77 $^{\circ}$C or cooled
to 0 $^{\circ}$C, and the other is a white, 800.0 dm^3^ PFR operated at 300 K
that cannot be heated or cooled but can be painted red or black. Note that
$k=0.07 dm^3/mol \dot min$ at 300 K and E = 20 kcal/mol.

- Which reactor and what conditions do you recommend?
  Explain the reason for your choice (e.g., color, cost, space available,
  weather conditions). Back up your reasoning with the appropriate
  calculations.

- How long would it take to achieve 90% conversion in a 200 dm^3^ batch reactor
  with C~A0~ = C~B0~ = 1 M after mixing at a temperature of 77$^{\circ}$C?

- What would your answer to part (b) be if the reactor were cooled to
  0$^{\circ}$C?

- What conversion would be obtained if the CSTR and PFR were operated at 300 K
  and connected in series? In parallel with 5 mol/min to each?

- Keeping @tbl-4-3 in mind, what batch reactor volume would be necessary to
  process the same amount of species A per day as the flow reactors, while
  achieving 90% conversion?

## P 5-11

The irreversible elementary gas-phase reaction

$$
\ce{A + B ->  C + D}
$$

is carried out isothermally at 305 K in a packed-bed reactor with 100 kg of catalyst.

The entering pressure was 20 atm and the exit pressure is 2 atm.
The feed is equal molar in A and B and the flow is in the turbulent flow
regime, with F~A0~ = 10 mol/min and C~A0~ = 0.4 mol/dm^3^. Currently 80%
conversion is achieved.
What would be the conversion if the catalyst particle size were doubled and
everything else remained the same?

## P 5-24

The gas-phase reaction

$$
\ce{A + B -> C + D}
$$

takes place isothermally at 300 K in a packed-bed reactor in which the feed is
equal molar in A and B with C~A0~ = 0.1 mol/dm^3^. The reaction is second order
in A and zero order in B.
Currently, 50% conversion is achieved in a reactor with 100 kg of catalysts for
a volumetric flow rate 100 dm^3^/min. The pressure-drop parameter, $\alpha$, is
$\alpha$ = 0.0099 kg^â€“1^.
If the activation energy is 10,000 cal/mol, what is the specific reaction rate
constant at 400 K?


## P 6-4

The elementary gas-phase reaction

$$
\ce{(CH3)3COOC(CH3)3 -> C2H6  + 2 CH3COCH3}
$$

$$
\ce{A -> B + 2 C}
$$

is carried out isothermally at 400 K in a flow reactor with no pressure drop.
The specific reaction rate at 50$^{\circ}$C is 10^-4^ min^-1^ (from pericosity
data) and the activation energy is 85 kJ/mol.
Pure *di-tert-*butyl peroxide enters the reactor at 10 atm and 127$^{\circ}$C
and a molar flow rate of 2.5 mol/min, i.e., F~A~ = 2.5 mol/min.

- Use the algorithm for molar flow rates to formulate and solve the problem.
  Plot F~A~, F~B~, F~C~, and then X as a function of plug-flow reactor volume
  and space time to achieve 90% conversion.

- Calculate the plug-flow volume and space time for a CSTR for 90% conversion.

## P 6-6
*(Membrane reactor)* The first-order, gas-phase, reversible reaction

$$
\ce{ A <=> B + 2 C }
$$

is taking place in a membrane reactor.
Pure A enters the reactor, and B diffuses out through the membrane.
Unfortunately, a small amount of the reactant A also diffuses through the
membrane.

- Plot and analyze the flow rates of A, B, and C and the conversion X down the
  reactor, as well as the flow rates of A and B through the membrane.

- Next, compare the conversion profiles in a conventional PFR with those of a
  membrane reactor from part (a). What generalizations can you make?

- Would the conversion of A be greater or smaller if C were diffusing out
  instead of B?

- Discuss qualitatively how your curves would change if the temperature were
  increased significantly or decreased significantly for an exothermic
  reaction. Repeat the discussion for an endothermic reaction.

**Fuel Cells Rationale.**
With the focus on alternative clean-energy sources, we are moving toward an
increased use of fuel cells to operate appliances ranging from computers to
automobiles. For example, the hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell produces clean energy
as the products are water and electricity, which may lead to a hydrogen-based
economy instead of a petroleum-based economy.
A large component in the processing train for fuel cells is the water-gas shift
membrane reactor. (M. Gummala, N. Gupla, B. Olsomer, and Z. Dardas, *Paper
103c*, 2003, AIChE National Meeting, New Orleans, LA.)

$$
\ce{CO + H2O <=> CO2 + H2}
$$

Here, CO and water are fed to the membrane reactor containing the catalyst.
Hydrogen can diffuse out the sides of the membrane, while $\ce{CO}$,
$\ce{H2O}$, and $\ce{CO2}$ cannot. Based on the following information, plot the
concentrations and molar flow rates of each of the reacting species down the
length of the membrane reactor.

Assume the following: The volumetric feed is 10 dm^3^/min at 10 atm, and the
equimolar feed of CO and water vapor with C~T0~ = 0.4 mol/dm^3^. The
equilibrium constant is K~e~ = 1.44, with k = 1.37 $dm^6/ \text{mol kg-cat}
\cdot \text{min}$, and the mass transfer coefficient $k_{H_2}$ = 0.1 $dm^3/
\text{kg-cat} \cdot \text{min}$

(Hint: First calculate the entering molar flow rate of CO and then relate F~A~
and X.)

- What is the membrane reactor volume necessary to achieve 85% conversion of CO?

- Sophia wants you to compare the MR with a conventional PFR. What will you
  tell her?

- For that same membrane reactor volume, Nicolas wants to know what would be
  the conversion of CO if the feed rate were doubled?
