## P 5-7

The gas-phase reaction

$$
\ce{A -> B + C} 
$$

follows an elementary rate law and is to be carried out first in a PFR and then
in a separate experiment in a CSTR. When pure A is fed to a 10 dm^3^ PFR at 300
K and a volumetric flow rate of 5 dm^3^/s, the conversion is 80%. When a
mixture of 50% A and 50% inert (I) is fed to a 10 dm^3^ CSTR at 320 K and a
volumetric flow rate of 5 dm^3^/s, the conversion is also 80%. What is the
activation energy in cal/mol?

## Solution

Gas phase elementary reaction

$$ \ce{A -> B + C} $$

Data: 

PFR: $V = 10 dm^3; V_0 = 5 dm^3/s; T = 300K; X = 0.8$

CSTR: $V = 10 dm^3; V_0 = 5 dm^3/s; T = 320K; X = 0.8; y_{A0} = 0.5; y_{I0} = 0.5$

Rate: $-r_A = k C_A = k_0 e^{-E/RT} C_{A0} (1 - X)$

For PFR: 

$$
\frac{dX}{dV} = \frac{-r_A}{F_{A0}}
$$

$$
\frac{dX}{dV} = \frac{k C_{A0} (1-X)}{C_{A0} \upsilon_0 (1 + \epsilon X)}
$$

$$
\therefore k \tau = \int_0^{0.8} \frac{(1 + \epsilon X)}{(1 - X)} dX 
$$

$$ \epsilon = y_{A0} \delta = 1 + (1 + 1 - 1) = 1 $$


```{python}
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import quad

def RHS(X, epsilon):
    return (1 + epsilon * X) / (1 - X)

epsilon = 1 
volume = 10
v_0 = 5
tau = volume/ v_0
X = 0.8

result, _ = quad(RHS, 0, X, args=(epsilon,))

k_pfr = result / tau
```

k from PFR experiment = `{python} f'{k_pfr:.3f}'` at 300 K


For CSTR: 

$$
V = \frac{F_{A0} X}{-r_A |_{exit}}
$$

$$
V = \frac{\upsilon_0 C_{A0} X}{k C_{A0} \frac{(1-X)}{(1 + \epsilon X)}}  
  = \frac{\upsilon_0 X (1 + \epsilon X)} {k (1-X)}
$$

$$
\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}(1 + 1 - 1) = 0.5
$$

$$ \tau = \frac{10}{2} = 2 s $$

$$
k = \frac{X (1 + \epsilon X)} {\tau (1 - X)}
$$


```{python}
#| echo: true

epsilon = 0.5 
tau = 2
X = 0.8

k_cstr = (X * (1 + epsilon * X))/ (tau * (1 - X)) 
```

k from CSTR experiment = `{python} f'{k_cstr:.3f}'` at 320 K

$$
\ln \frac{k_2}{k_1} = \frac{E}{R} \left[ \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \right]
$$

```{python}
#| echo: true

R = 1.987 
activation_energy =  np.log(k_cstr/k_pfr) * R /((1/300) - (1/320))
```

Activation energy = `{python} f'{activation_energy:.2f}'` cal/mol

## P 5-8

The elementary gas-phase reaction

$$
\ce{A -> B}
$$

takes place isobarically and isothermally in a PFR where 63.2% conversion is
achieved. The feed is pure A.

It is proposed to put a CSTR of equal volume upstream of the PFR. Based on the
entering molar flow rate to A to the first reactor, what will be the
intermediate from the CSTR, X~1~ , and exit conversion from the PFR, X~2~ ,
based on the feed to first reactor?

The entering flow rates and all other variables remain the same as that for the
single PFR.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution

![](../../../assets/images/problem_p5.8.png)

Gas phase reaction $\ce{A -> B}$. Isothermal, isobaric PFR

$X = 0.632$

Base case: PFR

$\frac{dX}{dV} = -r_A$

$-r_A = k C_A$

$C_A = C_{A0} (1 - X)$

$\tau k = \int_0^X \frac{1}{1-X} dX$

```{python}
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import quad

RHS = lambda x: 1 / (1 - x)
Xf = 0.632
tk, _ = quad(RHS, 0, Xf)
```

$\tau k$ = `{python} f'{tk:.2f}'`. 

CSTR added upstream of PFR. $\rightarrow$ equal volume. Therefore $\tau k$ =
`{python} f'{tk:.2f}'`. 

$$
V = \frac{F_{A0} X}{k C_{A0} (1-X)} \Rightarrow  \tau k =  \frac{X}{1 - X}
$$

$$
1 = \frac{X}{1 - X} \Rightarrow X_{1} = 0.5
$$

For $X_2$

$$
\tau k = \int_{X_1}^{X_2} \frac{dX}{1-X}
$$

This integral can be easily solved by analytical method

$$
1 = \ln \frac{1}{1-X_2} - \ln \frac{1}{1-X_1}
$$

$$ 
1 - \ln 2 = \ln \frac{1}{1-X_2}  \Rightarrow X_2 = 0.82
$$

Here's alternative numerical way to solve it. 

To calculate $X_2$ from a given $X_1$ and $\tau k$, where $\tau k$ is the
result of the definite integral from $X_1$ to $X_2$ of $\frac{dX}{1-X}$, you'll
need to perform the inverse operation. Essentially, you need to solve for $X_2$
in the equation $\tau k = \int_{X_1}^{X_2} \frac{dX}{1-X}$.

This operation is not straightforward because it requires finding the roots of
a function, which is an iterative numerical process. Python's `scipy` library
has methods such as `fsolve` for root finding.


```{python}
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import quad
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

# Function to perform the integral
def integral(x2, x1, tau_k):
    result, _ = quad(lambda x: 1 / (1 - x), x1, x2)
    return result - tau_k

x1 = 0.5 
tau_k = 1 

# Function to find the root of
def func(x2, *args):
    x1, tau_k = args
    return integral(x2, x1, tau_k)

# provide a good initial guess for x2
x2_guess = x1 + 0.1  

# Solve for x2
x2 = fsolve(func, x2_guess, args=(x1, tau_k))

```

$X_2$ =`{python} f'{x2[0]:.3f}'`.

## P 5-9

The liquid-phase reaction

$$
\ce{A + B -> C}
$$

follows an elementary rate law and is carried out isothermally in a flow system.
The concentrations of the A and B feed streams are 2 M before mixing.
The volumetric flow rate of each stream is 5 dm^3^/min, and the entering temperature is 300 K.
The streams are mixed immediately before entering.
Two reactors are available.
One is a gray, 200.0 dm^3^ CSTR that can be heated to 77 $^{\circ}$C or cooled
to 0 $^{\circ}$C, and the other is a white, 800.0 dm^3^ PFR operated at 300 K
that cannot be heated or cooled but can be painted red or black. Note that
$k=0.07 dm^3/mol \cdot min$ at 300 K and E = 20 kcal/mol.

- Which reactor and what conditions do you recommend?
  Explain the reason for your choice (e.g., color, cost, space available,
  weather conditions). Back up your reasoning with the appropriate
  calculations.

- How long would it take to achieve 90% conversion in a 200 dm^3^ batch reactor
  with C~A0~ = C~B0~ = 1 M after mixing at a temperature of 77$^{\circ}$C?

- What would your answer to part (b) be if the reactor were cooled to
  0$^{\circ}$C?

- What conversion would be obtained if the CSTR and PFR were operated at 300 K
  and connected in series? In parallel with 5 mol/min to each?

- Keeping @tbl-4-3 in mind, what batch reactor volume would be necessary to
  process the same amount of species A per day as the flow reactors, while
  achieving 90% conversion?

## P 5-11

The irreversible elementary gas-phase reaction

$$
\ce{A + B ->  C + D}
$$

is carried out isothermally at 305 K in a packed-bed reactor with 100 kg of catalyst.

The entering pressure was 20 atm and the exit pressure is 2 atm.
The feed is equal molar in A and B and the flow is in the turbulent flow
regime, with F~A0~ = 10 mol/min and C~A0~ = 0.4 mol/dm^3^. Currently 80%
conversion is achieved.
What would be the conversion if the catalyst particle size were doubled and
everything else remained the same?

*(Membrane reactor)* The first-order, gas-phase, reversible reaction

$$
\ce{ A <=> B + 2 C }
$$

is taking place in a membrane reactor.
Pure A enters the reactor, and B diffuses out through the membrane.
Unfortunately, a small amount of the reactant A also diffuses through the
membrane.

- Plot and analyze the flow rates of A, B, and C and the conversion X down the
  reactor, as well as the flow rates of A and B through the membrane.

- Next, compare the conversion profiles in a conventional PFR with those of a
  membrane reactor from part (a). What generalizations can you make?

- Would the conversion of A be greater or smaller if C were diffusing out
  instead of B?

- Discuss qualitatively how your curves would change if the temperature were
  increased significantly or decreased significantly for an exothermic
  reaction. Repeat the discussion for an endothermic reaction.

## P 6-7

**Fuel Cells Rationale.**
With the focus on alternative clean-energy sources, we are moving toward an
increased use of fuel cells to operate appliances ranging from computers to
automobiles. For example, the hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell produces clean energy
as the products are water and electricity, which may lead to a hydrogen-based
economy instead of a petroleum-based economy.
A large component in the processing train for fuel cells is the water-gas shift
membrane reactor. (M. Gummala, N. Gupla, B. Olsomer, and Z. Dardas, *Paper
103c*, 2003, AIChE National Meeting, New Orleans, LA.)

$$
\ce{CO + H2O <=> CO2 + H2}
$$

Here, CO and water are fed to the membrane reactor containing the catalyst.
Hydrogen can diffuse out the sides of the membrane, while $\ce{CO}$,
$\ce{H2O}$, and $\ce{CO2}$ cannot. Based on the following information, plot the
concentrations and molar flow rates of each of the reacting species down the
length of the membrane reactor.

Assume the following: The volumetric feed is 10 dm^3^/min at 10 atm, and the
equimolar feed of CO and water vapor with C~T0~ = 0.4 mol/dm^3^. The
equilibrium constant is K~e~ = 1.44, with k = 1.37 $dm^6/ \text{mol kg-cat}
\cdot \text{min}$, and the mass transfer coefficient $k_{H_2}$ = 0.1 $dm^3/
\text{kg-cat} \cdot \text{min}$

(Hint: First calculate the entering molar flow rate of CO and then relate F~A~
and X.)

- What is the membrane reactor volume necessary to achieve 85% conversion of CO?

- Sophia wants you to compare the MR with a conventional PFR. What will you
  tell her?

- For that same membrane reactor volume, Nicolas wants to know what would be
  the conversion of CO if the feed rate were doubled?
