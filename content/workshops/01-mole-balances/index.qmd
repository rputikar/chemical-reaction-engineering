Try following problems from Fogler 5e[@fogler2016].

Q 1-5, Q 1-6, P 1-4, P 1-5, P 1-8. 

We will go through some of these problems in the workshop. 


1. **Q 1-5**: What assumptions were made in the derivation of the design
   equation for:

   (a) The batch reactor (BR)?
   (b) The CSTR?
   (c) The plug-flow reactor (PFR)?
   (d) The packed-bed reactor (PBR)?
   (e) State in words the meanings of $–r_A$ and $–r′_A$.


2. **Q 1-6**: Use the mole balance to derive an equation analogous to Equation
   (1-7) ($V = (F_j0 - F_j)/ -r_j)$ for a fluidized CSTR containing catalyst
   particles ([@fig-q-1-6]) in terms of the catalyst weight, $W$, and other
   appropriate terms.

3. **P 1-4**: Schematic diagrams of the Los Angeles basin are shown in
   [@fig-p-1-4]. The basin floor covers approximately 700 square miles ( $2
   \cdot 10^{10} ft^2$ ) and is almost completely surrounded by mountain
   ranges. If one assumes an inversion height in the basin of 2,000 ft, the
   corresponding volume of air in the basin is ( $4 \cdot 10^{13} ft^3$ ). We
   shall use this system volume to model the accumulation and depletion of air
   pollutants. As a very rough first approximation, we shall treat the Los
   Angeles basin as a well-mixed container (analogous to a CSTR) in which there
   are no spatial variations in pollutant concentrations. 

   We shall perform an unsteady-state mole balance
   (Equation (1–4) ($F_j0 - F_j + \int^V r_j dV = dN_j/dt$)) on $\ce{CO}$ as it
   is depleted from the basin area by a Santa Ana wind. Santa Ana winds are
   high-velocity winds that originate in the Mojave Desert just to the
   northeast of Los Angeles. Load the Smog in Los Angeles
   Basin Web Module. Use the data in the module to work parts 1–12 (a) through
   (h) given in the module. Load the Living Example Polymath code and explore
   the problem. For part (i), vary the parameters $v_0$, a, and b, and write a
   paragraph describing what you find.

   There is heavier traffic in the L.A. basin in the mornings and in the
   evenings as workers go to and from work in downtown L.A. Consequently, the
   flow of CO into the L.A. basin might be better represented by the sine
   function over a 24-hour period.

4. **P 1-5**: The reaction $\ce{A -> B}$ is to be carried out isothermally in a
   continuous-ﬂow reactor. The entering volumetric flow rate $v_0$ is $10 dm^3/h$.
   (Note: $F_A = C_A v$. For a constant volumetric flow rate $v = v_0$ , then
   $F_A = C_A v_0$ . Also, $C_{A0} = F_{A0} ⁄ v_0 = ( [ 5 mol/h ] ⁄ [ 10 dm^3
   /h ] ) = 0.5 mol/dm^3.)$

   Calculate both the CSTR and PFR reactor volumes necessary to consume 99% of
   A (i.e., $C_A= 0.01 C_{A0}$) when the entering molar flow rate is $5 mol/h$,
   assuming the reaction rate $–r_A$ is

   (a) $–r_A = k$ with $k = 0.05 mol/h \cdot dm^3$
   (b) $–r_A = kC_A$ with $k = 0.0001 s^{–1}$
   (c) $–r_A = kC_A^2$ with $k = 300 dm^3/ mol \cdot h$
   (d) Repeat (a), (b), and/or (c) to calculate the time necessary to consume
       99.9% of species A in a $1000 dm^3$ constant-volume batch reactor with
       $C_{A0} = 0.5 mol/dm^3$.


5. We are going to consider the cell as a reactor. The nutrient corn steep
   liquor enters the cell of the microorganism Penicillium chrysogenum
   ([@fig-penicillium]) and is decomposed to form such products as amino acids.
   RNA. and DNA. Write an unsteady mass balance on 

   (a) the corn steep liquor.
   (b) RNA, and 
   (c) penicillin. Assume the cell is well mixed and that RNA remains inside
       the cell.
