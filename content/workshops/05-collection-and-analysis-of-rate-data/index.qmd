## P 7-4
When arterial blood enters a tissue capillary, it exchanges oxygen and carbon
dioxide with its environment, as shown in this diagram.

![](../../../assets/images/fig_p7.4.png)

The kinetics of this deoxygenation of hemoglobin in blood was studied with the
aid of a **tubular reactor** by Nakamura and Staub (*J. Physiol.*, 173, 161).

$$
\ce{HbO2 <=>[ $k_1$ ][ $k_{-1}$ ] Hb + O2}
$$

Although this is a reversible reaction, measurements were made in the initial
phases of the decomposition so that the reverse reaction could be neglected.
Consider a system similar to the one used by Nakamura and Staub: the solution
enters a tubular reactor (0.158 cm in diameter) that has oxygen electrodes
placed at 5-cm intervals down the tube.
The solution flow rate into the reactor is 19.6 cm^3^/s with C~A0~ = 2.33 ×
10^–6^ mol/cm^3^.

------------------------------------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ -------
       Electrode position               1      2      3      4      5      6       7
 Percent decomposition of $\ce{HbO2}$   0.00   1.93   3.82   5.68   7.48   9.25   11.00
------------------------------------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ -------

(a) Using the method of differential analysis of rate data, determine the
reaction order and the forward specific reaction-rate constant k~1~ for the
deoxygenation of hemoglobin.

(b) Repeat using regression.

## P 7-5
The liquid-phase irreversible reaction

$$
\ce{A -> B + C}
$$
is carried out in a CSTR.
To learn the rate law, the volumetric flow rate, $v_0$ , (hence $\tau = V /
v_0$ ) is varied and the effluent concentrations of species A are recorded as a
function of the space time t. 
Pure A enters the reactor at a concentration of 2 mol/ dm^3^.
Steady-state conditions exist when the measurements are recorded.

------------------ ----- ------ ----- ------ ------
       Run           1     2      3     4      5
   $\tau$ (min)      15    38    100   300    1200
 C~A~ (mol/dm^3^)   1.5   1.25   1.0   0.75   0.5
------------------ ----- ------ ----- ------ ------

(a) Determine the reaction order and specific reaction-rate constant.

(b) If you were to repeat this experiment to determine the kinetics, what would
you do differently? Would you run at a higher, lower, or the same temperature?
If you were to take more data, where would you place the measurements (e.g., $\tau$ )?

(c) It is believed that the technician may have made a dilution factor-of-10
error in one of the concentration measurements. What do you think?
How do your answers compare using regression (Polymath or other software) with
those obtained by graphical methods?

Note: All measurements were taken at steady-state conditions.


## P 7-6
The reaction

$$
\ce{ A -> B + C }
$$

was carried out in a constant-volume batch reactor where the following
concentration measurements were recorded as a function of time.

------------------ --- ----- ------ ----- ------ ------ ------ ------
     t (min)        0    5     9      15    22     30     40     60
 C~A~ (mol/dm^3^)   2   1.6   1.35   1.1   0.87   0.70   0.53   0.35
------------------ --- ----- ------ ----- ------ ------ ------ ------

(a) Use nonlinear least squares (i.e., regression) and one other method to
determine the reaction order, $\alpha$, and the specific reaction rate, k.

(b) Nicolas Bellini wants to know, if you were to take more data, where would
you place the points? Why?

(c) Prof. Dr. Sven Köttlov from Jofostan University always asks his students,
if you were to repeat this experiment to determine the kinetics, what would you
do differently? Would you run at a higher, lower, or the same temperature?
Take different data points?
Explain.

(d) It is believed that the technician made a dilution error in the
concentration measured at 60 min.

What do you think?
How do your answers compare using regression (Polymath or other software) with
those obtained by graphical methods?



## P 7-7

The following data were reported [from C. N. Hinshelwood and P. J. Ackey,
*Proc. R. Soc. (Lond)., A115*, 215] for a gas-phase constant-volume
decomposition of dimethyl ether at 504$^{\circ}$C in a batch reactor.
Initially, only $\ce{(CH3)2O}$ was present.

----------------------- ----- ----- ------ ------ ----------
        Time (s)         390   777   1195   3155   $\infty$
 Total Pressure (mmHg)   408   488   562    799    931
----------------------- ----- ----- ------ ------ ----------

(a) Why do you think the total pressure measurement at t = 0 is missing? Can
you estimate it?

(b) Assuming that the reaction

$$
\ce{(CH3)2O -> CH4 + H2 + CO}
$$

is irreversible and goes virtually to completion, determine the reaction order
and specific reaction rate k.

(c) What experimental conditions would you suggest if you were to obtain more
data?

(d) How would the data and your answers change if the reaction were run at a
higher temperature? A lower temperature?

## P 7-10

Tests were run on a small experimental reactor used for decomposing nitrogen
oxides in an automobile exhaust stream. In one series of tests, a nitrogen
stream containing various concentrations of $\ce{NO2}$ was fed to a reactor,
and the kinetic data obtained are shown in Figure P7-10.
Each point represents one complete run.
The reactor operates essentially as an isothermal backmix reactor (CSTR). What
can you deduce about the apparent order of the reaction over the temperature
range studied?

![Figure P7-10 - Auto exhaust data.](../../../assets/images/fig_p7.10.png){#fig-p7-10}

The plot gives the fractional decomposition of $\ce{NO2}$ fed versus the ratio
of reactor volume V (in cm^3^) to the NO~2~ feed rate, $F_{NO_{2,0}}$ (g
mol/h), at different feed concentrations of $\ce{NO2}$ (in parts per million by
weight). Determine as many rate law parameters as you can.
