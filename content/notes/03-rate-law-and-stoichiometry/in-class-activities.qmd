## Relative rates

1. For the reaction $\ce{2A + B -> 3C}$, calculate rates of reaction of B and C
   if $-r_A = 10 mol/(dm^3 s)$

2. $\ce{NO2}$ is being formed at a rate of 4 $mol/(m^3 s)$ in the reaction
   $\ce{2NO + O2 <=> 2NO2}$. Calculate the rate of consumption of $\ce{NO}$,
   and $\ce{O2}$. 


## Rate law

Determine the rate law for the reaction described in each of the cases below involving
species A, B, and C. The rate laws should be elementary as written for reactions that are
either of the form $\ce{A -> B}$ or $\ce{A + B -> C}$.

1. The units of the specific reaction rate are $k = \left[\frac{dm^3}{mol \ h} \right]$.
2. The units of the specific reaction rate are  $k = \left[\frac{mol}{kg-cat \ h \ (atm)^2} \right]$.
3. The units of the specific reaction rate are $k = \left[\frac{1}{h} \right]$.
4. The units of a nonelementary reaction rate are $k = \left[\frac{mol}{dm^3 \ h} \right]$.


## Rate law for reversible reaction

For the reaction 
$$ 
\ce{C6H6 <=>[{k_B}][{k_{-B}}] C6H4 + H2} (\ce{B <=> D + H2})
$$

determine the rate expression for disappearance of benzene ($-r_B$). Assume
both the forward and reverse reactions are elementary. 

## Calculate the activation energy 

The decomposition of benzene diazonium chloride to give chlorobenzene and nitrogen 

$$
\ce{C6H5N2Cl -> C6H5Cl + N2}
$$

follows first order kinetics. The rate constant data at different temperatures
is given in @tbl-ae. Calculate the activation energy.

## Calculate the equilibrium conversion for gas phase reaction, $X_e$

Consider the following elementary reaction with $K_C$ = 20 $dm^3/mol$ and
$C_{A0}$ = 0.2 $mol/dm^3$. Find $X_e$ for both a batch reactor.

Reaction: $\ce{2A <=> B}$

Rate law: $-r_A = k_A \left[ C_A^2 - \frac{C_B}{K_C} \right]$

## Repeat the calculations above for a flow reactor


## Saponification reaction

The saponification for the formation of soap is:

$$
\ce{3NaOH + (C17H35COO)3C3H5 -> 3C17H35COONa + C3H5(OH)3}
$$

Letting X represent the conversion of NaOH set up a stoichiometric table
expressing the concentration of each species in terms of the initial
concentration of NaOH and the conversion of X.

## Determining $C_j = h_j(X)$ for a Gas-Phase Reaction

A mixture Of 28% $\ce{SO2}$ and 72% air is charged to a flow reactor in which
$\ce{SO2}$ is oxidized.

$$
\ce{2SO2 + O2 -> 2 SO3}
$$

1. First, set up a stoichiometric table using only the symbols (i.e., $\Theta_i, F_i$).
   
2. Next, prepare a second table evaluating the species concentrations as a
   function of conversion for the case when the total pressure is 1485 kPa
   (14.7 atm) and the temperature is constant at 227 &deg;C.

3. Evaluate the parameters and make a plot of each of the concentrations $\ce{SO2}$,
   $\ce{SO3}$, $\ce{N2}$ as a function of conversion

##  Liquid phase first order reaction

*Orthonitroanaline* (an important intermediate in dyesâ€”called _fast orange_) is
formed from the reaction of *orthonitrochlorobenzene* (ONCB) and aqueous
ammonia. The liquid-phase reaction is first order in both ONCB and ammonia with
$k = 0.0017 \ m^3 /kmol \cdot min$ at $188 \ ^{\circ}C$ with $E = 11273 \  cal/mol$.
The initial entering concentrations of ONCB and ammonia are $1.8 \ kmol/m^3$ and
$6.6 \ kmol/m^3$, respectively.
