## Heat of reaction

Calculate the heat of reaction for the synthesis of ammonia from hydrogen and
nitrogen at 150 &deg;C in kcal/mol of N~2~ reacted and also in kJ/mol of H~2~
reacted.

$$
\ce{N2 + 3H2 -> 2NH3}
$$

The enthalpy of formation of ammonia at 25 &deg;C is $H_{NH_3}^\circ (T_R) =
-11020 \ cal/(mol\ \ce{NH3})$


## Adiabatic Liquid-Phase Isomerization of Normal Butane

Normal butane, $C_4H_{10}$, is to be isomerized to isobutane in a plug-flow
reactor. Isobutane is a valuable product that is used in the manufacture of
gasoline additives. For example, isooctane can be further reacted to form
iso-octane. The 2014 selling price of n-butane was \$1.5/gal, while the trading
price of isobutane was \$1.75/gal.

This elementary reversible reaction is to be carried out adiabatically in the
liquid phase under high pressure using essentially trace amounts of a liquid
catalyst that gives a specific reaction rate of $31.1 \, \text{h}^{-1}$ at $360
\, K$. The feed enters at $330 \, K$.

(a) Calculate the PFR volume necessary to process $100,000 \, \text{gal/day}$
($163 \, \text{kmol/h}$) at $70\%$ conversion of a mixture $90 \, \text{mol \%}
\, n$-butane and $10 \, \text{mol \%} \, i$-pentane, which is considered an
inert.

(b) Plot and analyze $X$, $X_e$, $T_r$, and $-r_A$ down the length of the
reactor.

(c) Calculate the CSTR volume for $40\%$ conversion.

**Additional information**:

$\Delta H^{\circ}_{Rx} = -6900 \, \text{J/mol} \, n$-butane, 

Activation energy = $65.7 \, \text{kJ/mol}$ 

$K_c = 3.03$ at $60°C$, 

$C_{A0} = 9.3 \, \text{mol/dm}^3 = 9.3 \, \text{kmol/m}^3$

Butane: 
$C_{P_{n-B}} = 141 \, J/mol \cdot K$; 
$C_{P_{i-B}} = 141 \, J/mol \cdot K$

i-Pentane: 
$C_{P_{i-P}} = 161 \, J/mol \cdot K$


## Adiabatic Equilibrium Temperature

For the elementary liquid-phase reaction

$\ce{A <=> B}$

Make a plot of equilibrium conversion as a function of temperature.

(a) Combine the rate law and stoichiometric table to write $-r_A$ as a
function of $k$, $C_{A0}$, $X$, and $X_e$.

(b) Determine the adiabatic equilibrium temperature and conversion when pure A
is fed to the reactor at a temperature of 300 K.

(c) What is the CSTR volume to achieve 90% of the adiabatic equilibrium
conversion for $\dot{v}_0 = 5 \, \text{dm}^3/\text{min}$?

Additional information:†

$H_A^\circ(298 \, K) = -40,000 \, \text{cal/mol}$

$H_B^\circ(298 \, K) = -60,000 \, \text{cal/mol}$

$C_{P,A} = 50 \, cal/mol \cdot K$

$C_{P,B} = 50 \, cal/mol \cdot K$

$K_c = 100,000 $ at 298 K, 
$k = 10^{-3} \exp \left( \frac{E}{R} \left( \frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{T} \right)
\right) \text{min}^{-1}$
with $E = 10,000 \, \text{cal/mol}$


## Interstage Cooling for Highly Exothermic Reactions

What conversion could be achieved in the previous example if two interstage
coolers that had the capacity to cool the exit stream to 350 K were available?
Also, determine the heat duty of each exchanger for a molar feed rate of A of
40 mol/s. Assume that 95% of the equilibrium conversion is achieved in each
reactor. The feed temperature to the first reactor is 300 K.

## Production of Acetic Anhydride

Jeffreys, in a treatment of the design of an acetic anhydride manufacturing
facility, states that one of the key steps is the endothermic vapor-phase
cracking of acetone to ketene and methane.

The reaction is as follows:
$$ \ce{ CH3COCH3 ->  CH2CO + CH4}$$

He states further that this reaction is first-order with respect to acetone and
that the specific reaction rate can be expressed by

$$\ln k = 34.34 - \frac{34,222}{T}$$

where $k$ is in reciprocal seconds and $T$ is in Kelvin. In this design
it is desired to feed 7850 kg of acetone per hour to a tubular reactor. The
reactor consists of a bank of 1000 one-inch schedule 40 tubes. We shall
consider four cases of heat exchanger operation. The inlet temperature and
pressure are the same for all cases at 1035 K and 162 kPa (1.6 atm) and the
entering heating-fluid temperature available is 1250 K.

A bank of 1000 one-inch, schedule 40 tubes 1.79 m in length corresponds to 1.0
m³ (0.001 m³/tube = 1.0 dm³/tube) and gives 20% conversion. Ketene is unstable
and tends to explode, which is a good reason to keep the conversion low.
However, the pipe material and schedule size should be checked to learn if they
are suitable for these temperatures and pressures. The heat-exchange fluid has
a flow rate, $\dot{m}_c$, of 0.111 mol/s, with a heat capacity of 34.5
J/mol·K.

The cases are as follows:

- Case 1: The reactor is operated adiabatically.
- Case 2: Constant heat-exchange fluid temperature $T_a = 1250$ K.
- Case 3: Co-current heat exchange with $T_{a0} = 1250$ K.
- Case 4: Countercurrent heat exchange with $T_{a0} = 1250$ K.

Additional information:
- For acetone (A): $\Delta H^{\circ}_{R}(T_R) = -216.67$ kJ/mol, $C_{p,A}
= 163$ J/mol·K
- For ketene (B): $\Delta H^{\circ}_{R}(T_R) = -61.09$ kJ/mol, $C_{p,B} =
83$ J/mol·K
- For methane (C): $\Delta H^{\circ}_{R}(T_R) = -74.81$ kJ/mol, $C_{p,C}
= 71$ J/mol·K

The overall heat transfer coefficient $Ua = 110$ J/s·m³·K.
