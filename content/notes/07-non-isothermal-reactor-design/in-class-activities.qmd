## Heat of reaction

Calculate the heat of reaction for the synthesis of ammonia from hydrogen and
nitrogen at 150 &deg;C in kcal/mol of N~2~ reacted and also in kJ/mol of H~2~
reacted.

$$
\ce{N2 + 3H2 -> 2NH3}
$$

The enthalpy of formation of ammonia at 25 &deg;C is $H_{NH_3}^\circ (T_R) =
-11020 \ cal/(mol\ \ce{NH3})$


## Adiabatic Liquid-Phase Isomerization of Normal Butane

Normal butane, $C_4H_{10}$, is to be isomerized to isobutane in a plug-flow
reactor. Isobutane is a valuable product that is used in the manufacture of
gasoline additives. For example, isooctane can be further reacted to form
iso-octane. The 2014 selling price of n-butane was \$1.5/gal, while the trading
price of isobutane was \$1.75/gal.

This elementary reversible reaction is to be carried out adiabatically in the
liquid phase under high pressure using essentially trace amounts of a liquid
catalyst that gives a specific reaction rate of $31.1 \, \text{h}^{-1}$ at $360
\, K$. The feed enters at $330 \, K$.

(a) Calculate the PFR volume necessary to process $100,000 \, \text{gal/day}$
($163 \, \text{kmol/h}$) at $70\%$ conversion of a mixture $90 \, \text{mol \%}
\, n$-butane and $10 \, \text{mol \%} \, i$-pentane, which is considered an
inert.

(b) Plot and analyze $X$, $X_e$, $T_r$, and $-r_A$ down the length of the
reactor.

(c) Calculate the CSTR volume for $40\%$ conversion.

**Additional information**:

$\Delta H^{\circ}_{Rx} = -6900 \, \text{J/mol} \, n$-butane, 

Activation energy = $65.7 \, \text{kJ/mol}$ 

$K_c = 3.03$ at $60°C$, 

$C_{A0} = 9.3 \, \text{mol/dm}^3 = 9.3 \, \text{kmol/m}^3$

Butane: 
$C_{P_{n-B}} = 141 \, J/mol \cdot K$; 
$C_{P_{i-B}} = 141 \, J/mol \cdot K$

i-Pentane: 
$C_{P_{i-P}} = 161 \, J/mol \cdot K$


## Adiabatic Equilibrium Temperature

For the elementary liquid-phase reaction

$\ce{A <=> B}$

Make a plot of equilibrium conversion as a function of temperature.

(a) Combine the rate law and stoichiometric table to write $-r_A$ as a
function of $k$, $C_{A0}$, $X$, and $X_e$.

(b) Determine the adiabatic equilibrium temperature and conversion when pure A
is fed to the reactor at a temperature of 300 K.

(c) What is the CSTR volume to achieve 90% of the adiabatic equilibrium
conversion for $\dot{v}_0 = 5 \, \text{dm}^3/\text{min}$?

Additional information:†

$H_A^\circ(298 \, K) = -40,000 \, \text{cal/mol}$

$H_B^\circ(298 \, K) = -60,000 \, \text{cal/mol}$

$C_{P,A} = 50 \, cal/mol \cdot K$

$C_{P,B} = 50 \, cal/mol \cdot K$

$K_c = 100,000 $ at 298 K, 
$k = 10^{-3} \exp \left( \frac{E}{R} \left( \frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{T} \right)
\right) \text{min}^{-1}$
with $E = 10,000 \, \text{cal/mol}$


## Interstage Cooling for Highly Exothermic Reactions

What conversion could be achieved in the previous example if two interstage
coolers that had the capacity to cool the exit stream to 350 K were available?
Also, determine the heat duty of each exchanger for a molar feed rate of A of
40 mol/s. Assume that 95% of the equilibrium conversion is achieved in each
reactor. The feed temperature to the first reactor is 300 K.
