- Read Chapter 5, and 6 from @fogler2016.

* Revise numerical solution of ordinary differential equations

  - We will be using `solve_ivp` interpolation function from the `scipy.interpolate` library. Go through
    documentation for
    [scipy.integrate.solve_ivp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html#scipy.integrate.solve_ivp)

  - Also look at [Python ODE solvers](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter22.06-Python-ODE-Solvers.html)

* For design equations in terms of conversion, many a times it is possible to
  obtain an analytical solution by integration. It is possible to obtain a
  solution to these integrals using symbolic mathematics. 
  
  - [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) is a Python library for symbolic
    mathematics. Go through [SymPY
    documentation](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html), particularly the
    section on
    [Integrals](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/integrals/integrals.html)
    to learn more.
