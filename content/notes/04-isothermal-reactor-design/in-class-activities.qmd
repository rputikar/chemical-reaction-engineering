## Apply reaction engineering algorithm

1. Derive the equation for batch time as a function of conversion for a second order reaction $-r_A = k_2C_A^2$

2. Derive equation for conversion in a liquid phase PFR for second order
   reaction $\ce{2A -> products}; -r_A = kC_A^2$ in terms of DamkÃ¶hler number $Da_2 = \tau k C_{A0}$
