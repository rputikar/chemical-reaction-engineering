## Apply reaction engineering algorithm

1. Derive the **equation for batch time** as a function of conversion for a second order reaction $-r_A = k_2C_A^2$

2. **Determining k from Batch Data**

   It is desired to design a CSTR to produce 200 million pounds of ethylene
   glycol per year by hydrolyzing ethylene oxide. However, before the design
   can be carried out, it is necessary to perform and analyze a batch-reactor
   experiment to determine the specific reaction-rate constant, $k$. Because
   the reaction will be carried out isothermally, the specific reaction rate
   will need to be determined only at the reaction temperature of the CSTR. At
   temperatures above $80^\circ C$, there is a significant by-product
   formation, while at temperatures below $40^\circ C$, the reaction does not
   proceed at a significant rate; consequently, a temperature of $55^\circ C$
   has been chosen. Because water is present in excess, its concentration (55.5
   $mol/dm^3$) may be considered constant during the course of the reaction.
   The reaction is first-order in ethylene oxide.

   $$
    \ce{C2H4O + H2O ->[H2SO4] (CH2-OH)2}
   $$

   $$
    \ce{A  + B ->[catalyst] C}
   $$

   In the laboratory experiment, 500 mL of a 2 M solution (2 $kmol/m^3$) of
   ethylene oxide (A) in water was mixed with 500 mL of water (B) containing
   0.9 wt% sulfuric acid, which is a catalyst. The temperature was maintained
   at $55^\circ C$. The concentration of ethylene glycol (C) was recorded as a
   function of time (@tbl-problem_1).

   #. Derive an equation for the concentration of ethylene glycol as a function
   of time.

   #. Rearrange the equation derived in (a) to obtain a linear plot of a
   function concentration versus time.

   #. Using the data in (@tbl-problem_1), determine the specific reaction rate at
   $55^\circ C$.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-problem_1
#| tbl-cap: "Concentration-Time Data"
#| echo: false


import pandas as pd
import tabulate as tab
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

# Data
data = {
  'Time (min)': [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 10.0],
  'Concentration of Ethylene Glycol (C) ($kmol/m^3$)': [0.000, 0.145, 0.270, 0.376, 0.467, 0.610, 0.715, 0.848, 0.957]
}
df = {}
df['data'] = pd.DataFrame(data)

md = tab.tabulate(df['data'].T, floatfmt='.2f')
display(Markdown(md))
```

3. Derive **equation for conversion in a liquid phase PFR** for second order
   reaction $\ce{2A -> products}; -r_A = kC_A^2$ in terms of DamkÃ¶hler number
   $Da_2 = \tau k C_{A0}$
