## Finding the RTD function by experiment

Plot the C-curve and E-curve for a response to a pulse input into a reactor
given in @tbl-problem_1. 

```{python}
#| label: tbl-problem_1
#| tbl-cap: "Concentration-Time Data"
#| echo: false

data = np.array([
    (0, 0), (5, 4), (10, 6), (15, 7), (20, 5),
    (25, 3), (30, 2), (35, 1), (40, 0)
], dtype=[('t(min)', float), ('$C_{\\text{tracer}} \ (g/dm^3)$', float)])

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
md = tab.tabulate(df.T, floatfmt='.2f')
display(Markdown(md))

```

## Constructing the $C(t)$ and $E(t)$ Curves

A sample of the tracer hytane at 320 K was injected as a pulse into a reactor, and the
effluent concentration was measured as a function of time, resulting in the data
shown in @tbl-problem_2

```{python}
#| label: tbl-problem_2
#| tbl-cap: "Concentration-Time Data"
#| echo: false

data = np.array([
    (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 5), (3, 8), (4, 10),
    (5, 8), (6, 6), (7, 4), (8, 3), (9, 2.2),
    (10, 1.5), (12, 0.6), (14, 0)
], dtype=[('t(min)', float), ('C ($g/m^3$)', float)])

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
md = tab.tabulate(df.T, floatfmt='.2f')
display(Markdown(md))
```

The measurements represent the exact concentrations at the times listed and not
average values between the various sampling tests.

* Construct a figure showing the tracer concentration $C(t)$ as a function of time.
* Construct a figure showing $E(t)$ as a function of time.

## Mean Residence Time and Variance Calculations

Using the data given in @tbl-problem_2 in the previous problem

*  Construct the $F(t)$ curve.
*  Calculate the mean residence time, $t_m$.
*  Calculate the variance about the mean, $\sigma^2$.
*  Calculate the fraction of fluid that spends between 3 and 6 minutes in the
   reactor.
*  Calculate the fraction of fluid that spends 2 minutes or less in the
   reactor.
*  Calculate the fraction of the material that spends 3 minutes or longer in
   the reactor.

## Step experiment

A step experiment is made on a reactor at $C_{in} ( t \ge 0 ) = 0.5 \ mol/dm^3$. 
The results are as given in @tbl-problem_3. 

```{python}
#| label: tbl-problem_3
#| tbl-cap: "Concentration-Time data from step experiment"
#| echo: false

data = np.array([
    (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0.1), (3, 0.2), (4, 0.3),
    (5, 0.4), (6, 0.5), (7, 0.5), (8, 0.5)
], dtype=[('t (min)', float), ('$C_{out} (mol/L)$', float)])

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
md = tab.tabulate(df.T, floatfmt='.2f')
display(Markdown(md))
```
Plot the Concentration - time curve, $F(t)$ curve and $E(t)$ curve.

## Mean conversion using segragation model

Using the pulse input response in @tbl-problem_1, calculate the mean conversion
in the reactor for first order reaction: $\ce{A ->[k] Products}$ with k = 0.1
$[min]^{-1}$.
