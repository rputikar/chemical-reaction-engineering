## Gas phase decomposition of azomethane

Consider the gas-phase decomposition of azomethane, AZO, to give ethane and
nitrogen

$$ \ce{(CH3)2N2 -> C2H6 + N2} $$

Experimental observations show that the rate of formation of ethane is first
order with respect to AZO at pressures greater than 1 atm (relatively high
concentrations)

$$ r_{\ce{C2H6}} \propto C_{AZO} $$

and second order at pressures below 50 mmHg (low concentrations):

$$ r_{\ce{C2H6}} \propto C_{AZO}^2 $$

We could combine these two observations to postulate a rate law of the form

$$ r_{\ce{C2H6}} =\frac{ k_1 C_{AZO}^2 } { 1 + k_2 C_{AZO} } $$

find a mechanism that is consistent with the experimental observations


## Decomposition of cumene to form benzene and propylene 

Develop rate laws for catalytic decomposition of cumene to form benzene and
propylene.

$$
\ce{ C6H5CH(CH3)2 -> C6H6 + C3H6  }
$$

## Rate law for catalytic reaction

Find the reaction rate law of the reaction

$$
\ce{ SO2 + 1/2 O2 -> SO3 }
$$

## Surface reaction limiting reaction

The reaction $\ce{ A + B <=> C + D }$$ is carried out over a solid catalyst,
the reaction mechanism is believed to be

$$
\begin{gather*}
\ce{A + S <=> A.S}
\ce{B + S <=> B.S}
\ce{A.S + B.S <=> C.S D.S}
\ce{C.S <=> C + S}
\ce{D.S <=> D + S}
\end{gather*}
$$

We assume step 3 is the slowest step, derive the rate law for the reaction.
