## Solve the following problems

1. In the Decon process for the manufacture of chlorine, a dry mixture of
   hydrochloric acid gas and air is passed over a heated catalyst which
   promotes oxidation of acid. Air is used 30% in excess of that theoretically
   required. Calculate the weight of airÂ·supplied per kilogram of the acid.
   (Atomic weight of chlorine = 35.5, Air contains 23.2% $\ce{O2}$ by weight)

2. Chlorobenzene ($\ce{C6H5Cl}$) is nitrated using a mixture of nitric acid and
   sulphuric acid. During the pilot plant run, a charge consists of 100 kg of
   chlorobenzene, 106.5 kg of nitric acid of 65.5% strength, 108 kg of
   sulphuric acid of 93.6% strength. After two hours of operation, tbc final
   product mixture was analysed and found to contain 2% unreacted
   chlorobenzene. Also, the product distribution was found to be 66%
   paranitrocblorobenzene and 34% orthonitrochloro-benzene (by weight). The
   chemical reaction involved are:

   $$
    \begin{gathered}
    \ce{C6H5Cl} + \ce{HNO3} \rightarrow o \ce{C6H4ClNO2} + \ce{H2O}  \\
    \ce{C6H5Cl} + \ce{HNO3} \rightarrow p \ce{C6H4ClNO2} + \ce{H2O} 
    \end{gathered}
   $$

   Calculate: 
   (a) analysis of charge, 
   (b) % conversion of chlorobenzene and
   (c) composition of the product mixture. (Atomic weight data: H = 1, N = 14,
   S = 32, Cl = 35.5)

3. Pure sulphur is burnt in a sulphur burner with dry air. Oxygen is used 20%
   excess above that required for the complete combustion of sulphur lo $\ce{SO3}$ The
   efficiency of burner is such that only 30% of the sulphur burns to $\ce{SO3}$ and
   remainder goes to $\ce{SO3}$.

   Calculate: 
   (a) the analysis of the resulting mixture in mole% and 
   (b) the weight of gas per kg of sulphur burnt.
