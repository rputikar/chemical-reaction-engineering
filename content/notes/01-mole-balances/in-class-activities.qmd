## Problems

1. Chloral is being consumed at a rate of 10 moles per second per m^3^ when
   reacting with chlorobenzene to form DDT and water in the reaction described
   above. In symbol form, the reaction is written as

   $$
   \ce{A + 2B -> C + D}
   $$

   Write the rates of disappearance and formation (i.e., generation) for each
   species in this reaction.


   ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
   ## Solution

   - Rate of disappearance of A: $-r_A =$ 10 $mol/m^3 \ s$
   - Rate of disappearance of B: $-r_B =$ 2*10 = 20 $mol/m^3 \ s$
   - Rate of formation of C: $r_C =$ 10 $mol/m^3 \ s$
   - Rate of formation of D: $r_D =$ 10 $mol/m^3 \ s$

2. A rocket engine, burns a stoichiometric mixture of fuel (liquid
   hydrogen) in oxidant (liquid oxygen). The combustion chamber is cylindrical,
   75 cm long and 60 cm in diameter, and the combustion process produces 108
   kg/s of exhaust gases. If combustion is complete, find the rate of reaction
   of hydrogen and of oxygen.

   ## Solution
   
   $V$ = 0.2121 $m^3$

   Reactions occuring: $\ce{H2 + 1/2 O2 -> H2O}$

   Molecular weights: $\ce{H2} = 2gm$; $\ce{O2} = 16gm$; $\ce{H2O} = 18gm$

   - $\ce{H2O}$ produced: 108/18 = 6 kmol/s
   - $\ce{H2}$ used: 6 kmol/s
   - $\ce{O2}$ used: 3 kmol/s

3. A human being (75 kg) consumes about 6000 kJ of food per day. Assume that I
   the food is all glucose and that the overall reaction is

   $$ 
   \ce{C6H12O6 + 6 O2 -> 6 CO2 + 6 H2O}, -\Delta H_r = 2816 kJ/mol 
   $$

   Find man's metabolic rate (the rate of living, loving, and laughing) in
   terms of moles of oxygen used per m^3^ of person per second. Assume average
   density of a human being to be $1000 kg/m^3$.

   ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
   ## Solution

   We want to find 

   $$
   -r'''_{O_2} = -\frac{1}{V_{person}} \frac{dN_{O_2}}{dt} \left[ \frac{mol O_2 used}{m^3 of \ person \ s}\right]
   $$

   $\rho_{person} = 1000 kg/m^3$

   $V_{person} = 75/1000 = 0.075 m^3$

   Each mole of glucose consumed uses 6 moles of oxygen and releases 2816 kJ of energy

   $$
   \frac{dN_{O_2}}{dt} = \left( \frac{6000 \ kJ/day}{2816 \ kJ/mol\ glucose}
   \frac{6 mol\ O_2}{1 mol\ glucose}\right) = 12.8 \frac{mol O_2}{day}
   $$

   $$
   -r'''_{O_2} = \frac{1}{0.075} \frac{12.8}{24 \cdot 3600} = 0.002 \frac{mol \ O_2 \ used}{m^3 s}
   $$

4. Consider the liquid phase cis – trans isomerization of 2–butene which we
   will write symbolically as

   $$
   cis- \ce{CH3HC=CHCH3} \rightarrow trans- \ce{CH3HC=CHCH3}
   $$

   The reaction is first order in A ($–r_A = kC_A$) and is carried out in a tubular
   reactor in which the volumetric flow rate,$v$, is constant, i.e.,$v = v_0$.

   1. Sketch the concentration profile.
   2. Derive an equation relating the reactor volume to the entering and
      exiting concentrations of A, the rate constant k, and the volumetric flow
      rate.
   3. Determine the reactor volume, $V_1$, necessary to reduce the exiting
      concentration to 10% of the entering concentration, i.e., $C_A = 0.1 C_{A0}$,
      when the volumetric flow rate is $10 dm^3/min$ (i.e., liters/min) and the
      specific reaction rate, k, is $0.23 1/min$.

   ## Solution
   
   **Concentration Profile**

   ![PFR concentration profile schematic](../../../assets/images/pfr_conc_profile_schematic.png)

   Rate equation:  $–r_A = kC_A$

   PFR mole balance: 
   $$\frac{dFA}{dV} = \frac{dC_A \upsilon_0}{dV} = r_A = - kC_A$$

   $$
   \frac{\upsilon_0}{k} \int_{C_{A_0}}^{C_A} \frac{dC_A}{C_A} = \int_0^V dV
   $$

   $$
   \frac{\upsilon_0}{k} \ln \frac{C_{A_0}}{C_A} = V
   $$

   ```{python}
   #| echo: true 

   import math

   # Data given

   k = 0.23             # 1/min
   Ca0_by_Ca = 1/ 0.1
   upsilon_0 = 10       # dm^3/min 

   V = (upsilon_0/k)* math.log(Ca0_by_Ca)

   ```

   `{python} "$V$ = {v:.2f} $m^3$""".format(v=V)`
