### Due date: 2025-03-07

### Task 1: Course Goals (10 Marks)  
Write a concise paragraph describing both the content goals and the
intellectual goals of this course. Explain what students are expected to learn
in terms of knowledge and skills.  

### Task 2: Reactor Identification (20 Marks)  
Explore the campus and identify five different reactors. Capture clear
photographs of each reactor and provide the following details:  

- A brief description (1-2 lines) of the reactor.  
- The chemical reactions that take place inside the reactor.  
- The reactor type (e.g., single-phase, multiphase, batch, semi-batch, continuous, etc.).  
- The ideal reactor model that best describes its behavior (e.g., PFR, CSTR, batch reactor).  
- Include photographs of each reactor.  

Hint: The reactors do not need to be conventional chemical reactors.
Consider any system where a chemical or biological reaction occurs.  

### Task 3: Industrial Processes (20 Marks)  
Conduct research on the following industrial processes and determine:  
- The main chemical reactions involved.  
- The types of reactors used in each process.  

1. Methane Reforming  
2. Electrolysis of Water  
3. Nitric Acid Production  
4. Iron Production  
5. Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis  

### Submission Guidelines  

- Page Limit: Maximum 5 pages (be concise).  
- Save your report as a PDF file.  
- Name your file as STUDENTID_Portfolio1.pdf.  
- Upload the file using the assessment submission link on Blackboard.  

Important Note: This portfolio does not contribute to your final mark, but
failing to complete it and/or achieve a pass mark will result in a 5-mark
deduction from your overall portfolio score.
