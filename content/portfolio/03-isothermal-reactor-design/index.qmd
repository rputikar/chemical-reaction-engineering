## General Instructions for take home Portfolios

1.  The portolio is an open-book task.
2.  It is expected that you will complete the portfolio assessment on your own.
    You can use textbooks, the resources provided during class/ workshop etc.
    to answer the questions. 
4.  You are free to choose a solution technique. It is **not** required that
    you use the provided python code to answer the questions. You can use any
    tool (pen and paper, excel, ... ) and any technique (graphical, numerical,
    analytical) that you are comfortable with. However, some of the tasks will
    require use of coding/ computer. 
5.  The tasks will be a mix of theory questions, short calculation type and
    long numerical examples.
6.  The portfolio tasks are not meant to take a lot of time. If you have
    understood and practiced the relevant content, it should take you around 2
    to 3 hours at the most.
7.  You are required to upload the portolio answers on to blackboard: 
    - Save your report as a **pdf** file (_Miri students should save it as a
      word file_). 
    - Rename the file as STUDENTID_Portfolio_x.pdf (Where STUDENTID is your
      student ID, and x is the portfolio number) and 
    - Upload it using assessment submission link on blackboard.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity at its core is about honesty and responsibility and is
fundamental to Curtin’s expectations of you. This means that all of your work
at Curtin should be your own and it should be underpinned by integrity, which
means to act ethically, honestly and with fairness.

As a Curtin student you are part of an academic community and you are asked to
uphold the University’s [Code of
Conduct](https://oasis.curtin.edu.au/ConductAtCurtin), principles of academic
integrity, and [Curtin’s five core
values](https://about.curtin.edu.au/who/vision-mission-values/curtin-values/)
of integrity, respect, courage, excellence and impact during your studies.

You are also expected to uphold the [Student
Charter](https://students.curtin.edu.au/essentials/rights/student-charter/) and
recognise that cheating, plagiarism collusion, and falsification of data and
other forms of academic dishonesty are not acceptable.

## Introduction

Ethylene oxide (EO) ($\ce{C2H4O}$), also known as oxirane, is a colorless,
flammable gas with a sweet, ether-like smell. EO is an important industrial
chemical used primarily to make ethylene glycol (a key ingredient in antifreeze
and polyester fiber) and other chemicals, such as surfactants, detergents, and
solvents.

In 2022, global production of EO was nearly 28 millions of tons and s expected
to grow at a steady CAGR of 4.07% during the forecast period until 2032. With a
selling price of $1913 per tonne, the commercial value of EO is around $53
billion.

The primary route for EO production involves the direct vapor phase oxidation
of ethylene in the presence of a silver catalyst: 

$$
\ce{C2H4 + 1/2 O2 -> C2H4O}
$$

This reaction is highly exothermic and requires careful control to manage the
risk of runaway reactions. The process typically involves a recovery stage to
separate EO from water and other byproducts.

We want to design a reactor achieve a desired conversion of ethylene. Ethylene
and oxygen (as air) are fed in stoichiometric proportions to a packed-bed reactor
operated isothermally at 280 $^\circ C$.

Ethylene and oxygen are fed in stoichiometric proportions to a packed-bed
reactor operated isothermally at 280 $^\circ C$. Ethylene is fed at a rate of
200 mol/s at a pressure of 10 atm (1013 kPa). It is proposed to use 10 banks
of 25.4 mm diameter schedule 40 tubes packed with catalyst with 100 tubes per bank.
Consequently, the molar flow rate to each tube is to be 0.2 mol/s. 

The rate law for the reaction is

$$
-r'_A = k P_A^{1/3} P_B^{2/3}
$$

with k = 0.00392 $\frac{mol}{atm \ kg-cat\ s}$ at 260 $^\circ C$. The heat of
reaction, $\Delta H$ is -106.7 kJ/mol and the activation energy, E is 69.49
kJ/mol.

## Questions

1. Isobaric reactor \hfill (10 marks)

   Using the mole balances developed in portfolio 02, determine the weight of
   catalyst required to achieve 60% conversion in a PBR. Show your working by
   following the reaction engineering algorithm. State your assumptions if any.

2. Effect of pressure drop \hfill (20 marks)

   As this is a gas phase reaction carried out in a PBR, there is a significant
   pressure drop. The properties of the reacting fluid are to be considered
   identical to those of air at this temperature and pressure. The density of the
   6.35 mm catalyst particles is 1925 $kg/m^3$, the bed void fraction is 0.45,
   and the gas density is 16 $kg/m^3$. For these catalyst properties, the pressure
   drop parameter $\alpha$ is 0.0367 $1/kg$ 

   a. How will the equations change when you consider pressure drop?

   b. Draw the profiles of concentrations of reactants and products,
      conversion, volumetric flow rate ratio ($\upsilon/\upsilon_0$), and
      pressure ratio ($P/P_0$) as a function of catalyst weight. 

   c. Estimate the catalyst weight required to achieve 60% conversion
      considering pressure drop. Compare the results with those obtained in
      question 1.
