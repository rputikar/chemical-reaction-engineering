## Pre-requisites

- CHEN2000 (v.0) Mass and Energy Balances or any previous version
- CHEN2001 (v.0) Thermodynamics or any previous version 
- COMP1005 (v.0) Fundamentals of Programming or any previous version

### Python and Jupyter notebook

We will extensively use python (and Jupyter notebooks) for computationally
demanding tasks (such as solving ordinary differential equations). Course
specific instructions will be provided as we go along. There are several
options for using Jupyter notebooks. Here are a few pointers for using Jupyter
notebooks.

### Excel

We will also use excel for calculations and data analysis. Here is a good
introductory series on using Excel for engineering applications. [Excel

## Attendance and participation

It is **crucial** to complete the required pre-class activities for each
session **before** watching the lecture.  

Your active participation and preparedness are key to your success in this
course. **This means reading the assigned material and watching the videos
before class.** Doing so will help you engage in discussions and collaborate
effectively with your peers.  

Attendance and participation are essential. All activities are designed for
in-person sessions, and some lectures, workshops, or lab activities **will not
be recorded**. If you expect to miss a session, you must request an extension
and complete the lab work independently.  

That said, I am here to support you. If you are facing any challenges that may
affect your participation—whether attending a session, sitting for a test, or
completing a project—please inform me as soon as possible, and I will do my
best to accommodate your needs.
