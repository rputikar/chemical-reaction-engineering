## Course materials

### Books

The books listed in [the course reading
list](https://curtin.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/61CUR_INST/lists/15697875750001951)
will be very userful reference material for topics covered in the course.   

The content is mainly based on Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering (@fogler2016)

Besides these books the following books are useful as well. 

- Chemical reaction engineering (@levenspiel1999)
- Chemical reaction engineering and reactor technology (@salmi2019)
