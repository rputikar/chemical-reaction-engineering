## Prelab Module

## Objective {#sec-1}

To find the reaction rate constant in a stirred batch reactor.

The saponification reaction of sodium hydroxide and ethyl acetate

$$\ce{NaOH + CH3COOC2H5 -> CH3COONa + C2H5OH}$$ {#eq-rxn}

$$\text{Sodium Hydroxide}  + \text{Ethyl Acetate} \longrightarrow \text{Sodium
Acetate} + \text{Ethyl Alcohol}$$

is elementary as written. The rate equation is given by $-r_A = k C_A C_B$,
Where, A is \ce{NaOH}, and B is \ce{CH3COOC2H5}. We would like to determine the
rate constant $k$ using a batch system.

## Experimental procedure

The experiment will be carried out in a transparent batch reactor ([Armfield
Limited, model: CEB-MKIII](./CEB-MKIII-Issue-3-Instruction-Manual.pdf)). Refer
to the instruction manual for the reactor setup to understand more about the
experimental setup.
A [virtual tour](../prelab/Batch_Reactor/index.htm) is also provided that
describes the setup in detail.

For this experiment, Reactions are monitored by conductivity probe as the
conductivity of the solution changes with conversion of the reactants to
product. The reaction eventually reaches steady state when a certain amount of
conversion of the starting reagents has taken place. The steady state
conditions will vary depending on concentration of reagents, stirrer speed,
volume of reactor and temperature of reaction. This experiment will be repeated
at various temperatures to investigate the relationship between the specific
rate constant and the temperature of reaction.

### Steps

1. Prepare 500ml 0.05M sodium hydroxide and 500ml 0.05M ethyl acetate.

2. Open Armfield Software and choose ‘Isothermal operation’.

3. Set up the Hot Water Circulator and adjust the set point of the PID to 30°C.

4. Add 500ml of the sodium hydroxide solution into the batch reactor.

5. Set the reactor agitator to '50%' and press ‘Power on’ to start the
   agitation. Then press ‘Hot Water Circulator’ and water will start to
   recirculate through jacket reactor and vessel.

6. After temperature reaches 30 $^{\circ}$C, add 500ml EtAc. Start record data.

7. The degree of conversion of the reagents affects the conductivity of the
   reactor contents so recording the conductivity over time can be used to
   calculate the amount of conversion. Collection of data will be until a
   stable condition is reached in the reactor and this takes approximately 30
   minutes. It is advisable to set the data collection period to, say, 45
   minutes.

8. Switch on the Hot Water Circulator. The temperature of the sodium hydroxide
   in the reactor vessel will begin to rise and will be automatically
   maintained at the desired set-point (30 $^{\circ}$C in this instance) by the
   action of the HWC in the jacket

9. To obtain data at different temperatures, we repeat the experiment at 25
   $^{\circ}$C and 35 $^{\circ}$C.

10. Top up the level of this vessel as necessary to maintain the level above
    the tip of the level electrode (typically 20 mm from the top of the
    vessel).

As the experiment involves the collection and storage of conductivity data, the
data output port in the plinth must be connected to the computer with Armfield
Interface data logger. This will enable data logging of the conductivity,
temperatures and stirrer speed values at selected time intervals over a
selected period. Ensure the conductivity and temperature sensors have both been
installed in accordance with the Installation section. When operating
isothermally the temperature sensor T2 supplied with CEXC should be set as the
temperature sensor to be controlled in the PID loop box on the software. This
sensor must be immersed in the vessel of the Hot Water Circulator. The T1
temperature sensor can be used to follow the temperature in the reactor.

## Data analysis

<!-- Batch Reactor: --> <!-- The conductivity of experiment is contributed by
NaOH and NaAc. The standard procedure is to fill NaOH solution then EtAc, so
that NaOH is consumed by EtAc and the conductivity decreases. The possible
mistake made by students is filling EtAc first, which means the conductivity
increases with NaOH gets more. In this case, the rate constant is negative and
the Arrhenius law cannot be used to obtain the activation energy. The rate
constant is positive, which is the knowledge used to identify which result is
correct. -->

Having recorded the conductivity of the contents of the reactor over the period
of the reaction, the conductivity measurements must now be translated into
degree of conversion of the constituents. Both sodium hydroxide and sodium
acetate contribute conductance to the reaction solution whilst ethyl acetate
and ethyl alcohol do not. The conductivity of a sodium hydroxide solution at a
given concentration and temperature however, is not the same as that of a
sodium acetate solution at the same molarity and temperature and a relationship
has been established allowing conversion to be inferred from conductivity.

On conclusion of the experiment, the set of readings of conductivity with time
are obtained. The calculations required for converting the conductivity data
into concentration are given in the instruction manual "CEB-MKIII Issue 3
Instruction Manual.pdf"

## Theoretical analysis {#sec-2}

Consider a batch reactor as shown in @fig-1 below.

We establish a mole balance for the reaction \ce{A + B -> C + D} in this reactor.

The mole balance is written as

$$\frac{dN_A}{dt}=r_A V$${#eq-molbal}

Let,

$N_{A_0}$ : No. of moles of A initially present

$X$ : Conversion at time t

$N_{A_0}X$ : No. of moles of A consumed at time t

$N_{A}$ : No. of moles of A in system at time t

$N_{A} = N_{A_0}-N_{A_0}X = N_{A_0}(1-X)$

### Stoichiometric table

The stoichiometric table is given in @tbl-1.

| Species   | Initially (mol)    | Change (mol)     | Remaining (mol)                           |
| :-------- | :----------------- | :--------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| A         | $N_{A_0}$          | $-N_{A_0}X$      | $N_A = N_{A_0} - N_{A_0}X$                |
| B         | $N_{B_0}$          | $-(b/a)N_{A_0}X$ | $N_B = N_{B_0} -(b/a)N_{A_0}X$            |
| C         | $N_{C_0}$          | $(c/a)N_{A_0}X$  | $N_C = N_{C_0} +(c/a)N_{A_0}X$            |
| D         | $N_{D_0}$          | $(d/a)N_{A_0}X$  | $N_D = N_{D_0} +(d/a)N_{A_0}X$            |
| I         | $N_{I_0}$          | 0                | $N_I = N_{I_0}$                           |
| **Total** | $\mathbf{N_{T_0}}$ |                  | $\mathbf{N_T = N_{T_0} + \delta N_{A_0}X}$ |

Table: Stoichiometric table {#tbl-1}

$$\delta = +\frac{d}{a}+\frac{c}{a}-\frac{b}{a}-1$$ 

### Equations for the concentration in a batch system

$$C_A = \frac{N_A}{V} = \frac{N_{A_0}(1-X)}{V}$$ 
$$C_B = \frac{N_B}{V} = \frac{N_{B_0}-(b/a)N_{A_0}X}{V}$$ 
$$C_C = \frac{N_C}{V} = \frac{N_{C_0}+(c/a)N_{A_0}X}{V}$$ 
$$C_D = \frac{N_D}{V} = \frac{N_{D_0}+(d/a)N_{A_0}X}{V}$$ 

For a constant volume batch reactor, $V = V_0$.
Let $\phi_i = N_{i_0}/N_{A_0} =  C_{i_0}/C_{A_0}$.
Then,

$$C_A = C_{A_0}(1-X)$$ 
$$C_B = C_{A_0}(\phi_B-(b/a)X)$$ 
$$C_C = C_{A_0}(\phi_C+(c/a)X)$$ 
$$C_D = C_{A_0}(\phi_D+(d/a)X)$$ 

### Rate expression

$$ -r_A = k C_A C_B $$ 
$$ -r_A = k  C_{A_0}^2 (1-X) (\phi_B-(b/a)X)$$ 

For $C_{A_0}= C_{B_0}$, and $b/a = 1$

$$ -r_A = k  C_{A_0}^2 (1-X)^2 $$ 

Therefore, mole balance (@eq-molbal) becomes

$$\frac{dC_A}{dt}=-k C_{A_0}^2 (1-X)^2$$ {#eq-molbalx}

as $C_A = C_{A_0}(1-X)$; $dC_A = -C_{A_0} dX$

The mole balance (@eq-molbalx) can then be written as

$$\frac{dX}{(1-X)^2}=k C_{A_0} dt$$ 

Integrating,

$$\int_0^x \frac{dX}{(1-X)^2} = \int_0^t k C_{A_0} dt$$ 

$$\frac{X}{1-X} = k C_{A_0} t$$ 

$$\left[\frac{C_{A_0}-C_A}{C_A} \right] \left[\frac{1}{C_{A_0}(1-X)} \right]= k t$$ 

$$\frac{C_{A_0}-C_A}{C_A C_{A_0}} = k t$$ {#eq-rateconst}

@eq-rateconst shows that a plot of $\frac{C_{A_0}-C_A}{C_A C_{A_0}} \text{ with
} t$ is a straight line with a slope of k.
