* Selection of reactor system is key to economic success or failure of a
  chemical plant 

* Understanding how chemical reactors work lies at the heart of almost every
  chemical processing operation.

## What is reaction engineering

:::: {.columns}

::: {.incremental}

- CRE is the field that studies the rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions
  and the design of the reactors in which they take place.

- Reactor design is a specialized task that involves evaluating various options.
  It draws on knowledge from thermodynamics, kinetics, fluid mechanics, and heat
  and mass transfer, along with economic considerations.

- CRE is the synthesis of all these factors with the aim of properly designing
  and understanding the chemical reactor.

It is the primary knowledge of chemical kinetics and reactor design that
distinguishes the chemical engineer from other engineers
