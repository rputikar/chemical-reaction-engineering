* Selection of reactor system is key to economic success or failure of a
  chemical plant 

* Understanding how chemical reactors work lies at the heart of almost every
  chemical processing operation.

::: {.notes}
Typically, all chemical processes are designed to convert raw materials to
produce a product that meet all the quality specifications and is ready for the
market.

These chemical processes broadly involve three steps. 

Initially, the raw materials are subjected to a sequence of physical treatments
to refine them into a form suitable for chemical reaction. This may include the
removal of impurities that could adversely affect the catalyst within the
reactor. 

These materials, once treated, are introduced into the reactor, which is the
central component of the process. In this stage, the raw materials are
chemically transformed, yielding a mixture of desired products along with
by-products.

The reaction step typically does not yield pure products due to unreacted raw
materials and the formation of by-products. Consequently, a separation step is
essential after the reaction to isolate the desired products from the undesired
ones. 

Materials that do not react are returned to the beginning of the chemical
process. This recycling is critical for efficient raw material utilization,
ensuring the process remains economically viable.

The economic success of any chemical process is critically dependent on the
design of the reactor. It requires a delicate balance â€“ minimizing the costs
associated with the reactor itself while also accounting for the expense
involved in treating materials after the reaction has taken place. 

Therefore, understanding how chemical reactors work lies at the heart of almost
every chemical processing operation.

## What is reaction engineering

:::: {.columns}

* CRE is the field that studies the rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions
  and the design of the reactors in which they take place.

* Reactor design is a specialized task that involves evaluating various options.
  It draws on knowledge from thermodynamics, kinetics, fluid mechanics, and heat
  and mass transfer, along with economic considerations.

* CRE is the synthesis of all these factors with the aim of properly designing
  and understanding the chemical reactor.

:::{.notes}

In unit operations, we focus on the design of equipment for the physical
treatment steps. Whereas, chemical reaction engineering is concerned with the
chemical treatment step of a process.

Chemical reaction engineering, or CRE, is dedicated to understanding the rates
at which chemical reactions occur and the underlying mechanisms. CRE is also
about the design of the reactors themselves, where these reactions take place.

The real challenge in CRE is to bring together knowledge from thermodynamics,
chemical kinetics, and even economics. Our aim is to create reactors that are
not just efficient at processing materials but also cost-effective. This
balance is key to the economic feasibility of the entire chemical process.

So, CRE is about synthesis. It's about combining all these complex factors to
design a reactor that we fully understand and that operates optimally.

And it's this specific knowledge in chemical kinetics and reactor design that
really sets chemical engineers apart from other engineers. It's our domain,
where we apply our specialized skills to make a significant impact in the field
of chemical processing.

:::{.notes}

To evaluate a reactor's performance, we need to establish a performance
equation. This mathematical relationship correlates the inputs like
concentrations, flow rates, and temperatures to outputs including product
concentration, temperature, and conversion. This equation is crucial for
comparing different reactor designs and operational conditions, optimizing
performance, and scaling up from laboratory to industrial scale.

Understanding the contacting pattern is also essential. This refers to the
manner in which materials move and interact within the reactor, including the
timing of their mixing and their physical characteristics such as clumpiness or
dispersal. For instance, some materials naturally form clumps, like solids, or
may not easily mix, like certain noncoalescing liquids.

Kinetics, the study of reaction rates, is a fundamental aspect of reaction
engineering. If reactions occur quickly, equilibrium conditions will largely
dictate the reactor's output. For slower reactions, the reaction rate,
alongside heat and mass transfer rates, become significant factors in
determining the reactor's performance. These principles allow chemical
engineers to design reactors that meet specific process requirements.
