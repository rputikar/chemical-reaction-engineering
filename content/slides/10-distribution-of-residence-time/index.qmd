## General Considerations

:::{.incremental .pad}
* Models developed so far are for perfectly mixed batch reactor, the plug flow
  tubular reactor, packed bed reactor, and perfectly mixed continuous tank
  reactor.

* Real world behavior is often very different from the ideal behavior.

* Use residence time distribution to analyze and characterize non-ideal
  reactors.

  - diagnose problems of reactor operations

  - predict conversion in existing reactor when new chemical reaction is used
    in the reactor.

* Describing deviation from ideal reactor mixing pattern

  - Residence time distribution (RTD)
  - Quality of mixing
  - Model used to describe the system
 
* Residence time distribution (RTD) function

  Popularized by Prof. P. V. Dankwerts

## Residence Time Distribution (RTD) function

:::{.pad50}

:::{.incremental .pad}

Residence time: The time atoms have spent in the reactor.
:::

* Plug flow reactor: Atoms spend exactly the same time in these two reactors.

* Ideal batch reactor: Atoms spend exactly the same time in these two reactors.

* CSTR: Feed introduced into a CSTR becomes completely mixed with the material
  already in the reactor.

  - Some atoms entering the CSTR leave almost immediately.
  - Other atoms remain in the reactor almost forever as all the material
    recirculates within the reactor and is virtually never removed from the
    reactor at one time.

* Distribution of residence times can significantly affect reactor performance.

  - The RTD is a characteristic of the mixing that occurs in the chemical
    reactor.

  - RTD yields distinctive clues to the type of mixing occurring within it and
    is one of the most informative characteristics of the reactor.

:::

## Measurement of the RTD

:::{.incremental}

* Determined experimentally
  - Injecting tracer into the reactor at some time $t=0$
    and then measuring the tracer concentration $C$ in the effluent stream as a
    function of time. 

  :::{.pad50}
  ![](../../../assets/images/experimental-setup-rtd.png){width=90%}
  :::

* Properties of Tracer
  - Inert (non-reactive)
  - Easily detectable
  - Similar physical properties to the reacting mixture
  - Completely soluble in the reacting mixture
  - Does not adsorb on reactor walls
  - Tracer behavior should mimic the behavior of material flowing in the reactor.

* Common tracers: colored dye, radioactive material, inert gases

:::

## Pulse input experiment

![](../../../assets/images/pulse-tracer-experiment.png){width=90%}

* An amount of tracer $N_0$ is suddenly injected in one shot into the feed stream.
* Outlet concentration is measured with time.

- Consider single-input and single-output system:
  - Only flow carries the tracer material.
  - No dispersion.
  - Increment of time $\Delta t$ is sufficiently small that the concentration
    of tracer $C(t)$ exiting between $t$  and $t + \Delta t$ is essentially the same.

- Amount of tracer material leaving the reactor between $t$ and $(t + \Delta t)$:
  $$
  \Delta N = C(t) \cdot \upsilon \cdot \Delta t \quad \text{where } \upsilon \text{ is the volumetric flow rate}
  $${#eq-1}

## Pulse input experiment

* Dividing by the Total Amount of Material that was Injected

$$
\frac{\Delta N}{N_0} = \frac{\upsilon C(t)}{N_0} \Delta t
$${#eq-2}

$\Rightarrow$ Fraction of material that has residence time in the reactor
between $t$ and $t + \Delta t$


* For pulse injection let

$$
E(t) = \frac{\upsilon C(t)}{N_0} \quad \text{... Residence time function}
$$

* Residence time function
  
  Function that describes in a quantitative manner how much time different fluid elements have spent in the reactor

$$
\therefore \frac{\Delta N}{N_0} = E(t) \Delta t
$$


## Pulse input experiment

- $E(t) dt$ is the fraction of fluid exiting the reactor that has spent between
  time  $t$ and $t + \Delta t$ inside the reactor.

- If $N_0$ is not known directly, it can be obtained from the outlet
  concentration measurements by summing up all the amounts from $0  \text{ to } \infty$

* Writing @eq-1 in Differential Form

  $$
  dN = \upsilon C(t) dt
  $$

* Integrating

  $$
  N_0 = \int_{0}^{\infty} \upsilon C(t) dt
  $$

  $\upsilon$ is usually constant, therefore

  :::{.box .center}
  $$
  E(t) = \frac{C(t)}{\int_{0}^{\infty} C(t) dt}
  $${#eq-3}
  :::

  * $E(t)$ is also called exit age distribution function

## Pulse input experiment

* The E curve is just the C curve divided by the area under the C curve.

  $$
  = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} E(t) \, dt
  $$

* Fraction of all material that has resided for a time t in the reactor between $t = 0$ and $t = \infty$ is 1

  $$
  \int_{0}^{\infty} E(t) \, dt = 1
  $$

## Difficulties with pulse technique

:::{.pad .incremental}
* Obtaining a reasonable pulse at the reactor entrance
  - Injection time should be very short compared to residence times in various
  segments of the reactor.
  - There must be negligible dispersion between the point of injection and the
  entrance to the reactor.

* If these conditions are achieved, pulse technique is a simple and direct way
to obtain RTD.
:::

## Step tracer experiment

![](../../../assets/images/step-tracer-experiment.png){width=90%}

* Inlet is either:
  - Perfect pulse input (Dirac delta function)
  - Imperfect pulse, determine $E(t)$

* Cumulative distribution $F(t)$ can be determined from step input.

* Cumulative distribution gives the fraction of material $F(t)$ that has been
  in the reactor at time $t$ or less.

## Step tracer experiment

* Consider constant tracer addition to a feed that is initiated at $t = 0$

$$
C_{\text{in}}(t) = 
\begin{cases} 
0 & t < 0 \\ 
C_0, \text{constant} & t \ge 0 
\end{cases}
$$


* The concentration of tracer in feed is kept at this level until the
  concentration in the effluent is almost the same as the feed.


- As inlet concentration is constant with time, $C_0$, we can take it out of
  the integral sign:

$$
C_{\text{out}}(t) = C_0 \int_{0}^{t} E(t') dt'
$$

- Dividing by $t_0$:

$$
\left[ \frac{C_{\text{out}}(t)}{C_0} \right]_{\text{step}} = \int_{0}^{t} E(t') dt' = F(t)
$$

## Step tracer experiment

$$
F(t) = \left[ \frac{C_{\text{out}}(t)}{C_0} \right]_{\text{step}}
$${#eq-5}

* We differentiate @eq-5 to obtain RTD function:

$$
E(t) = \frac{dF}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left[ \frac{C_{\text{out}}(t)}{C_0} \right]_{\text{step}}
$$

* Positive step is usually easier to carry out experimentally than the pulse test.

* Total amount of tracer in feed over the period of test does not have to be known

* Drawbacks

  - It may be difficult to maintain constant tracer concentration in the feed.
  - Obtaining RTD involves differentiation of the data. ( differentiation can lead to large errors. )
  - A large amount of tracer is required.

* Other Tracer Techniques

  - Negative step (elution), Frequency response method, Methods that use inputs other than pulse or step

  - These techniques are much more difficult to carry out and are not encountered often.

![](../../../assets/images/f-curve.png){width=90%}
:::

Sometimes $F$ curve is used in the same manner as the RTD in modeling chemical
reactors. 

:::

:::{.column width=50%}

* Fraction of effluent that has been in the reactor for less than $t$

  $$
  F(t) = \int_{0}^{t} E(t) \, dt
  $$

* Fraction of effluent that has been in the reactor for longer than $t$

  $$
  1 - F(t) = \int_{t}^{\infty} E(t) \, dt
  $$

:::

## Mean residence time

* First moment of the RTD function

:::{.box .center}

$$
t_m = \frac{\int_0^\infty t E(t) dt}{\int_0^\infty E(t) dt} =  \int_0^\infty t E(t) dt
$$

:::

* In absence of dispersion, and for constant volumetric flow rate,

  $$ t_m = \tau \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad V = \upsilon t_m \qquad \text{ only for closed systems } $$

### Other moments of RTD

* Variance ($\sigma^2$): Magnitude indicates spread of distribution

  $$ \sigma^2 = \int_0^\infty (t - t_m)^2 E(t) dt $$

* Skewness ($s^3$): Magnitude measures extent that distribution is skewed in
  one direction in reference to mean

  $$ s^3 = \frac{1}{\sigma^{3/2}} \int_0^\infty (t - t_m)^3 E(t) dt $$

## Normalized RTD function

* Frequently a normalized function is used instead of $E(t)$.

* Let $\theta \equiv \frac{t}{\tau}$ : Number of reactor volumes of fluid based
  on entrance conditions that have flowed through the reactor in time $t$

  $$
  E(\theta) = \tau E(t) \qquad; \qquad   \int_{0}^{\infty} E(\theta) d\theta = 1
  $$

* The flow performance inside reactors of different sizes can be compared directly.

* If normalized function $E(\Theta)$ is used, all perfectly mixed CSTRs have
  numerically the same RTD. If the simple function $E(t)$ is used, numerical
  values of $E(t)$ can differ substantially.

![](../../../assets/images/normalized-rtd-function.png){width=90%}

## Internal-age distribution $I(\alpha)$

- A function such that $I(\alpha) \Delta \alpha$ is the fraction of
  material inside the reactor that has been inside for a period of time between
  $\alpha$ and $\alpha + \Delta \alpha$.

- In catalytic reaction using catalyst whose activity decays with time,
  $I(\alpha)$ is of importance and can be used to model the reactor.

  $$
  I(\alpha) = \frac{(1 - F(\alpha))}{\tau}
  $$

  $$
  E(\alpha) = -\frac{d}{d\alpha} \left[ \tau I(\alpha) \right]
  $$

* For CSTR

  $$
  I(\alpha) = -\frac{1}{\tau} e^{-\alpha / \tau}
  $$


## RTD in ideal reactors: batch and PFR 

* $E(t) = \delta(t - \tau)$  *(Dirac delta function)*

  $$
  \delta(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  0 & \text{when } x \neq 0    \\ 
  \infty & \text{when } x = 0   
  \end{cases}
  $$

* Properties of Dirac delta function

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(x) dx = 1 
\qquad ; \qquad
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x) \delta(x - \tau) dx = g(\tau)
$$

* Mean Residence Time

$$
t_m = \int_{0}^{\infty} t E(t) dt = \int_{0}^{\infty} t \delta(t - \tau) dt = \tau
$$


* Variance 
$$
\sigma^2 = \int_{0}^{\infty} (t - \tau)^2 \delta(t - \tau) dt = 0 
$$

:::{.notes}

* Variance Calculation
  - The variance $\sigma^2$ measures the spread of residence times around the mean residence time $\tau$.
  - For an ideal plug flow reactor, there is no spread because every particle has the same residence time.
  - Therefore, when calculating the variance using the delta function, the
    integrand $(t - \tau)^2$ is zero at $t = \tau$, and since $\delta(t - \tau)$ is
    zero everywhere else, the integral evaluates to zero:
    
    $$
    \sigma^2 = \int_{0}^{\infty} (t - \tau)^2 \delta(t - \tau) \, dt = 0
    $$

:::

## Single-CSTR RTD

* Concentration in effluent stream is identical to the concentration throughout
  the reactor.

* Material balance on an inert tracer injected as a pulse at  $t = 0$

$$ \text{In} - \text{Out} = \text{Accumulation}
\Rightarrow
0 - \upsilon C = V \frac{dC}{dt}
$$

* Initial Condition: $\text{at } t = 0 \quad C = C_0$

$$
C(t) = C_0 e^{-t/\tau}
$$

* RTD Function

$$
E(t) = \frac{C(t)}{\int_{0}^{\infty} C(t) dt} = \frac{C_0 e^{-t/\tau}}{\int_{0}^{\infty} C_0 e^{-t/\tau} dt} = \frac{e^{-t/\tau}}{\tau}
$$

## Single-CSTR RTD

* Normalized RTD Function

$$
E(\theta) = e^{-\theta} \quad \text{where} \quad \theta = \frac{t}{\tau} ; \quad E(\theta) = \tau E(t)
$$

* Cumulative Distribution Function $F(t)$

  $$
  F(t) = \int_{0}^{t} E(t)dt = \int_{0}^{t} \frac{e^{-t/\tau}}{\tau} dt
  $$

  $$
  F(t) = 1 - e^{-t/\tau}; F(\theta) = 1 - e^{-\theta}
  $$

* Mean residence time
  $$
  t_m = \int_{0}^{\infty} t E(t) dt = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{t}{\tau} e^{-t/\tau} dt = \tau
  $$

  $$
  \sigma^2 = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{(t - \tau)^2}{\tau} e^{-t/\tau} dt = \tau^2 \int_{0}^{\infty} (x - 1)^2 e^{-x} dx = \tau^2
  $$

* $\sigma = \tau$: Standard deviation is as large as the mean

## PFR/CSTR series RTD

* In some stirred tanks, there is a highly agitated zone in the vicinity of the
  impeller $\rightarrow$ CSTR

* Depending on the location of the inlet and outlet, the reacting mixture may
  follow a tortuous path either before entering or after leaving the perfectly
  mixed zone $\rightarrow$ PFR

![](../../../assets/images/early-late-mixing.png){width=90%}

## PFR/CSTR series RTD

* Early mixing: $C = C_0 e^{-t/\tau_s}$; $\tau_s$: CSTR mean RT; $\tau_p$: PFR mean RT

  This conc. output will be delayed by $\tau_p$ at the outlet plug flow section

* RTD
$$
E(t) = 
\begin{cases} 
0 & t < \tau_p \\
\frac{e^{-(t - \tau_p) / \tau_s}}{\tau_s} & t \ge \tau_p 
\end{cases}
$$

* Late Mixing

$$
E(t) = 
\begin{cases} 
0 & t < \tau_p \\
\frac{e^{-(t - \tau_p) / \tau_s}}{\tau_s} & t \ge \tau_p 
\end{cases}
$$

* Exactly same as early mixing
* Even though RTD will be the same for both these cases, conversion can be very
  different
* RTD is not a complete description of the structure for a particular reactor /
  reactor systems
