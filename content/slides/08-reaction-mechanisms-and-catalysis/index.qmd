## Nonelementary rate laws

* Rate law is typically determined from experimental data

* Elementary reaction kinetics: the reaction orders and stoichiometric
  coefficients are identical

* Nonelementary reaction kinetics: no direct correspondence between reaction
  order and stoichiometry

  $$
  \ce{CH3CHO -> CH4 + CO}; \qquad -r_{\ce{CH3CHO}} = k C_{\ce{CH3CHO}}^{3/2}
  $$

  $$
  \ce{H2 + Br2  -> 2 HBr}; \qquad 
  -r_{\ce{HBr}} = \frac{ k_1 C_{\ce{H2}} C_{\ce{Br2}}^{3/2} }
                       { C_{\ce{H2}} + k_2 C_{\ce{Br2}} }
  $$


* Why the rate laws are complicated? $\rightarrow$ Reaction mechanism

* Use the experimental rate law to postulate a reaction mechanism

In practice, knowledge of the reaction mechanism helps use to design better
catalyst, troubleshoot, aid in troubleshooting poor reactor performance

## Nonelementary rate laws

* Nonelementary kinetics are the result of multiple elementary reaction steps

* One or more active intermediates are involved

### Active Intermediate

* A high energy species that reacts further very fast. It is consumed as fast
  as it is formed

* It can be 
  - A high energy molecule
  - A free radical
  - An ionic Intermediate 

* It is present at extremely low concentration.


## Pseudo-Steady-State Hypothesis (PSSH)

* Net rate of formation of reactive intermediate $\approx$ 0

* If the active intermediate appears in n reactions, then

:::{.box .center}

$$
r_{A^*} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} r_{i, A^*} = 0
$$

### How do we determine the mechanism?

* Postulate a reaction mechanism that is a series of elementary reactions

* Derive a rate equation for the postulated mechanism

* Is the rate equation for the postulated mechanism consistent with the
  experimental results?


## Searching for a mechanism

*  Propose an active intermediate(s).
*  Propose a mechanism, utilizing the rate law obtained from experimental data,
   if possible.
*  Model each reaction in the mechanism sequence as an elementary reaction.
*  After writing rate laws for the rate of formation of desired product, write
   the rate laws for each of the active intermediates.
*  Write the net rate of formation for the active intermediate and use the
   PSSH.
*  Eliminate the concentrations of the intermediate species in the rate laws by
   solving the simultaneous equations developed in Steps 4 and 5.
*  If the derived rate law does not agree with experimental observation, assume
   a new mechanism and/or intermediates and go to Step 3. A strong background
   in organic and inorganic chemistry is helpful in predicting the activated
   intermediates for the reaction under consideration.

## Catalysts & catalysis

* Definition 

  - Fogler: A substance that affects the rate of a reaction but emerges from
    the process unchanged.

  - Ostwald (1895): A catalyst accelerates a chemical reaction without
    affecting the position of the equilibrium.

* Positive catalyst increases reaction rate.
* Negative catalyst decreases reaction rate.

* About 75% of all chemicals are produced by catalytic process.

* Catalyst can be:
	- Gas ($\ce{NO_x}$)
	- Liquid ($\ce{H2SO4}$)
	- Solid ($\ce{Ni}$)

  Note: In this lecture only solid catalysts will be considered.
