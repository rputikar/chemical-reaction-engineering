## Nonelementary rate laws

* Rate law is typically determined from experimental data

* Elementary reaction kinetics: the reaction orders and stoichiometric
  coefficients are identical

* Nonelementary reaction kinetics: no direct correspondence between reaction
  order and stoichiometry

  $$
  \ce{CH3CHO -> CH4 + CO}; \qquad -r_{\ce{CH3CHO}} = k C_{\ce{CH3CHO}}^{3/2}
  $$

  $$
  \ce{H2 + Br2  -> 2 HBr}; \qquad 
  -r_{\ce{HBr}} = \frac{ k_1 C_{\ce{H2}} C_{\ce{Br2}}^{3/2} }
                       { C_{\ce{H2}} + k_2 C_{\ce{Br2}} }
  $$


* Why the rate laws are complicated? $\rightarrow$ Reaction mechanism

* Use the experimental rate law to postulate a reaction mechanism

In practice, knowledge of the reaction mechanism helps use to design better
catalyst, troubleshoot, aid in troubleshooting poor reactor performance

## Nonelementary rate laws

* Nonelementary kinetics are the result of multiple elementary reaction steps

* One or more active intermediates are involved

### Active Intermediate

* A high energy species that reacts further very fast. It is consumed as fast
  as it is formed

* It can be 
  - A high energy molecule
  - A free radical
  - An ionic Intermediate 

* It is present at extremely low concentration.


## Pseudo-Steady-State Hypothesis (PSSH)

* Net rate of formation of reactive intermediate $\approx$ 0

* If the active intermediate appears in n reactions, then

:::{.box .center}

$$
r_{A^*} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} r_{i, A^*} = 0
$$

### How do we determine the mechanism?

* Postulate a reaction mechanism that is a series of elementary reactions

* Derive a rate equation for the postulated mechanism

* Is the rate equation for the postulated mechanism consistent with the
  experimental results?


## Searching for a mechanism

*  Propose an active intermediate(s).
*  Propose a mechanism, utilizing the rate law obtained from experimental data,
   if possible.
*  Model each reaction in the mechanism sequence as an elementary reaction.
*  After writing rate laws for the rate of formation of desired product, write
   the rate laws for each of the active intermediates.
*  Write the net rate of formation for the active intermediate and use the
   PSSH.
*  Eliminate the concentrations of the intermediate species in the rate laws by
   solving the simultaneous equations developed in Steps 4 and 5.
*  If the derived rate law does not agree with experimental observation, assume
   a new mechanism and/or intermediates and go to Step 3. A strong background
   in organic and inorganic chemistry is helpful in predicting the activated
   intermediates for the reaction under consideration.


## Rules of thumb for development of a mechanism

* Species having the concentration(s) appearing in the denominator of the rate
  law probably collide with the active intermediate

  $$
  \ce{M + A* -> [Collision products]} \qquad -r_{A1}^* = k_1 C_M C_{A \cdot}
  $$

* If a constant appears in the denominator, one of the reaction steps is
  probably the spontaneous decomposition of the active intermediate

  $$
  \ce{A* -> [Decomposition products]} \qquad -r_{A2}^* = k_2 C_{A \cdot}
  $$

* Species having the concentration(s) appearing in the numerator of the rate
  law probably produce the active intermediate in one of the reaction steps

  $$
  \ce{[Reactants] -> A* + [Other products]} \qquad r_{A3}^* = k_3  C_{Reactants}
  $$

## PSSH explanation for common first-order reactions

* PSSH theory helps to explain why many reactions, such as the decomposition of
  dimethyl ether commonly exhibit first-order kinetics

  $$
  \ce{(CH3)2O -> CH4 + H2 + CO}
  $$

* $\ce{ A -> Products }; \qquad -r_A = k C_A$

  The reaction is first order but not elementary. 

* Mechanism

  - Activation:k $\ce{A + M ->[k_1] A^* + M}; \qquad r_{1,\ce{A^*}} = k_1 C_A C_M$ 

  - Deactivation: $\ce{A^* + M ->[k_2] A + M}; \qquad r_{2,\ce{A^*}} = k_2 C_{\ce{A^*}} C_M$ 

  - Decomposition: $\ce{A^* ->[k_3] P}; \qquad r_{3,\ce{A^*}} = k_3 C_{\ce{A^*}}$  

* Rate of formation of product

  $r_p = k_3 C_{\ce{A^*}}$

  Need to eliminate $C_{\ce{A^*}}$


## PSSH explanation for common first-order reactions

* PSSH: $r_{A^*} = 0$ 

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  r_{A^*} &= k_1 C_A C_M - k_2 C_{A^*} C_M - k_3 C_{A^*} = 0 \\
  \\
  k_1 C_A C_M &= C_{A^*} (k_2 C_M + k_3) \\
  \\
  C_{A^*} &= \frac{k_1 C_A C_M}{k_2 C_M + k_3} \\
  \\
  r_P &= \frac{k_3 k_1 C_A C_M}{k_2 C_M + k_3}
  \end{aligned}
  $$

* $C_M$ is constant

  $$
  k = \frac{k_3 k_1 C_M}{k_2 C_M + k_3}
  $$

  and

  $$
  -r_A = k C_A
  $$





## Catalysts & catalysis

* Definition 

  - Fogler: A substance that affects the rate of a reaction but emerges from
    the process unchanged.

  - Ostwald (1895): A catalyst accelerates a chemical reaction without
    affecting the position of the equilibrium.

* Positive catalyst increases reaction rate.
* Negative catalyst decreases reaction rate.

* About 75% of all chemicals are produced by catalytic process.

* Catalyst can be:
	- Gas ($\ce{NO_x}$)
	- Liquid ($\ce{H2SO4}$)
	- Solid ($\ce{Ni}$)

  Note: In this lecture only solid catalysts will be considered.
