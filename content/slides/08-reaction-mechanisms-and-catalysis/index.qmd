## Nonelementary rate laws

* Rate law is typically determined from experimental data

* Elementary reaction kinetics: the reaction orders and stoichiometric
  coefficients are identical

* Nonelementary reaction kinetics: no direct correspondence between reaction
  order and stoichiometry

  $$
  \ce{CH3CHO -> CH4 + CO}; \qquad -r_{\ce{CH3CHO}} = k C_{\ce{CH3CHO}}^{3/2}
  $$

  $$
  \ce{H2 + Br2  -> 2 HBr}; \qquad 
  -r_{\ce{HBr}} = \frac{ k_1 C_{\ce{H2}} C_{\ce{Br2}}^{3/2} }
                       { C_{\ce{H2}} + k_2 C_{\ce{Br2}} }
  $$


* Why the rate laws are complicated? $\rightarrow$ Reaction mechanism

* Use the experimental rate law to postulate a reaction mechanism

In practice, knowledge of the reaction mechanism helps use to design better
catalyst, troubleshoot, aid in troubleshooting poor reactor performance 

:::

## Nonelementary rate laws

* Nonelementary kinetics are the result of multiple elementary reaction steps

* One or more active intermediates are involved

### Active Intermediate

* A high energy species that reacts further very fast. It is consumed as fast
  as it is formed

* It can be 
  - A high energy molecule
  - A free radical
  - An ionic Intermediate 

* It is present at extremely low concentration.


## Pseudo-Steady-State Hypothesis (PSSH)

* Net rate of formation of reactive intermediate $\approx$ 0

* If the active intermediate appears in n reactions, then

:::{.box .center}

$$
r_{A^*} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} r_{i, A^*} = 0
$$

### How do we determine the mechanism?

* Postulate a reaction mechanism that is a series of elementary reactions

* Derive a rate equation for the postulated mechanism

* Is the rate equation for the postulated mechanism consistent with the
  experimental results?


## Searching for a mechanism

*  Propose an active intermediate(s).
*  Propose a mechanism, utilizing the rate law obtained from experimental data,
   if possible.
*  Model each reaction in the mechanism sequence as an elementary reaction.
*  After writing rate laws for the rate of formation of desired product, write
   the rate laws for each of the active intermediates.
*  Write the net rate of formation for the active intermediate and use the
   PSSH.
*  Eliminate the concentrations of the intermediate species in the rate laws by
   solving the simultaneous equations developed in Steps 4 and 5.
*  If the derived rate law does not agree with experimental observation, assume
   a new mechanism and/or intermediates and go to Step 3. A strong background
   in organic and inorganic chemistry is helpful in predicting the activated
   intermediates for the reaction under consideration.


## Rules of thumb for development of a mechanism

* Species having the concentration(s) appearing in the denominator of the rate
  law probably collide with the active intermediate

  $$
  \ce{M + A* -> [Collision products]} \qquad -r_{A1}^* = k_1 C_M C_{A \cdot}
  $$

* If a constant appears in the denominator, one of the reaction steps is
  probably the spontaneous decomposition of the active intermediate

  $$
  \ce{A* -> [Decomposition products]} \qquad -r_{A2}^* = k_2 C_{A \cdot}
  $$

* Species having the concentration(s) appearing in the numerator of the rate
  law probably produce the active intermediate in one of the reaction steps

  $$
  \ce{[Reactants] -> A* + [Other products]} \qquad r_{A3}^* = k_3  C_{Reactants}
  $$

## PSSH explanation for common first-order reactions

* PSSH theory helps to explain why many reactions, such as the decomposition of
  dimethyl ether commonly exhibit first-order kinetics

  $$
  \ce{(CH3)2O -> CH4 + H2 + CO}
  $$

* $\ce{ A -> Products }; \qquad -r_A = k C_A$

  The reaction is first order but not elementary. 

* Mechanism

  - Activation:k $\ce{A + M ->[k_1] A^* + M}; \qquad r_{1,\ce{A^*}} = k_1 C_A C_M$ 

  - Deactivation: $\ce{A^* + M ->[k_2] A + M}; \qquad r_{2,\ce{A^*}} = k_2 C_{\ce{A^*}} C_M$ 

  - Decomposition: $\ce{A^* ->[k_3] P}; \qquad r_{3,\ce{A^*}} = k_3 C_{\ce{A^*}}$  

* Rate of formation of product

  $r_p = k_3 C_{\ce{A^*}}$

  Need to eliminate $C_{\ce{A^*}}$


## PSSH explanation for common first-order reactions

* PSSH: $r_{A^*} = 0$ 

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  r_{A^*} &= k_1 C_A C_M - k_2 C_{A^*} C_M - k_3 C_{A^*} = 0 \\
  \\
  k_1 C_A C_M &= C_{A^*} (k_2 C_M + k_3) \\
  \\
  C_{A^*} &= \frac{k_1 C_A C_M}{k_2 C_M + k_3} \\
  \\
  r_P &= \frac{k_3 k_1 C_A C_M}{k_2 C_M + k_3}
  \end{aligned}
  $$

* $C_M$ is constant

  $$
  k = \frac{k_3 k_1 C_M}{k_2 C_M + k_3}
  $$

  and

  $$
  -r_A = k C_A
  $$


## Catalysts & catalysis

* Definition 

  - Fogler: A substance that affects the rate of a reaction but emerges from
    the process unchanged.

  - Ostwald (1895): A catalyst accelerates a chemical reaction without
    affecting the position of the equilibrium.

* Positive catalyst increases reaction rate.
* Negative catalyst decreases reaction rate.

* About 75% of all chemicals are produced by catalytic process.

* Catalyst can be:

  :::{.smaller}

	- Gas ($\ce{NO_x}$): 
	  Nitric Oxide (NO) for the Ostwald Process: In the industrial synthesis of
	  nitric acid, nitric oxide acts as a catalyst in the oxidation of ammonia to
	  nitrogen dioxide. This is part of a gas-phase reaction system where NO is
	  regenerated and acts catalytically.

	- Liquid ($\ce{H2SO4}$):
    Sulfuric Acid in Alkylation: Used in the oil refining industry, sulfuric
    acid serves as a liquid phase catalyst in alkylation reactions where
    isobutane is alkylated with olefins to produce higher molecular weight
    isoparaffins. The reaction occurs in the liquid phase, with sulfuric acid
    enhancing the reaction by protonating the olefin to form a more reactive
    carbocation intermediate.

	- Solid ($\ce{Ag}$):
    Silver on Alumina for Ethylene Oxide Production: Silver deposited on an
    alumina support is a crucial catalyst for the oxidation of ethylene to
    ethylene oxide, a precursor in the production of ethylene glycol. This is an
    example of a solid catalyst used in a gas-phase reaction, highlighting the
    versatility of catalyst forms and applications.

## Adsorption step

* Chemisorption is a necessary part of catalytic processes

* Adsorption data are often presented using
adsorption isotherms, which show how much gas is adsorbed by a solid at various
pressures at a constant temperature.

* We first propose an adsorption mechanism and derive an
isotherm from it. This theoretical isotherm is then compared with experimental
data.

* If the theoretical isotherm aligns well with the
experimental data, it suggests that the model accurately reflects the physical
processes occurring within the system. Discrepancies between the predicted and
actual data indicate that the model may not capture one or more crucial aspects
of the physical system.

## Langmuir isotherm: molecular adsorption


* The adsorption of A (gas phase) on an active site S is represented by:

  $$
  \ce{A(g) + S <=> A*S }
  $$

  S is a vacant surface site.
  $\ce{A*S}$ is A bound to a surface site. 

* Rate of adsorption = rate of attachment - rate of detachment

  $$
  r_{AD} = k_A P_A C_v - k_{-A} C_{\ce{A*S}}
  $$ 

  - The rate is directly proportional to the number of collisions between the
    reactant molecules and the catalyst surface, which is influenced by the partial
    pressure of the reactant ($P_A$).
  
  - Additionally, the reaction rate is dependent on the availability of vacant
    active sites on the catalyst surface. 

* Adsorption equilibrium constant  $K_A = k_A/k_{-A}$

  $$
  r_{\text{AD}} = k_A P_A C_v - k_{-A} C_{\ce{A*S}}
  \qquad
  r_{\text{AD}} = k_A \left( P_A C_v - \frac{k_{-A}}{k_A} C_{\ce{A*S}} \right)
  $$

  $\Rightarrow r_{\text{AD}} = k_A \left( P_A C_v - \frac{C_{\ce{A*S}}}{K_A} \right)$


## Site balance

:::{style="margin-bottom: 50px;"}
:::
 
![](../../../assets/images/vacant-and-active-sites.png){width=90%}

:::{style="margin-bottom: 50px;"}
:::

* $C_t$: Total number of active sites per unit mass of catalyst divided by
  Avogadro’s number (mol/g cat)

* $C_v$: Number of vacant sites per unit mass of catalyst divided by Avogadro’s
  number

* $C_v$ is not measurable, but the total number of sites $C_t$ can be measured

* Site balance

  In the absence of catalyst deactivation, assume the total number of active
  sites remains constant:

  $$
  C_t = C_v + C_{\ce{A*S}} + C_{\ce{B*S}}
  $$

* We will use the site balance equation to put $C_v$ in terms of measurable species


## Langmuir isotherm: molecular adsorption

* Site balance

  $$
  C_t = C_v + C_{\ce{A*S}}
  $$

* At equilibrium: 
  The net rate of adsorption is zero. 
  Setting $r_{AD}=0$ we can obtain equation for concentration of A adsorbed on
the surface

  $$
  C_{\ce{A*S}} = K_A C_v P_A
  \qquad
  C_{\ce{A*S}} = K_A P_A (C_t - C_{\ce{A*S}})
  $$

* Langmuir isotherm: 
  By rearranging, we obtain the Langmuir isotherm

:::{.box .center}
$$
C_{\ce{A*S}} = \frac{K_A P_A C_t} {1 + K_A P_A}
$$
:::

* This equation relates the equilibrium concentration of A adsorbed on the
surface, $C_{\ce{A*S}}$, as a function of the partial pressure of A


* Linearized form

$$
\frac{P_A}{C_{\ce{A*S}}} = \frac{1}{K_A C_t} + \frac{P_A}{C_t}
$$
  
## Langmuir isotherm: Dissociative adsorption

* Consider the adsorption of CO on iron where CO dissociates into separate atoms

  $$
  \ce{CO + 2S <=> C*S + O*S}
  $$

  Dissociative adsorption requires two adjacent vacant sites, unlike molecular
  adsorption that needs only one.

* The likelihood of finding two adjacent vacant sites is proportional to the
square of the concentration of vacant sites, in line with the law of mass
action.

* Consequently, the rate of adsorption is proportional to the product of the
carbon monoxide partial pressure and the square of the vacant-site
concentration.

* For desorption, two adjacent occupied sites are needed, making the rate of
desorption proportional to the product of the occupied-site concentrations
$C_\ce{C*S}$ and $C_{\ce{O*S}}$.

* The net rate of adsorption

  $$
  r_{AD} = k_A P_{\ce{CO}} C_v^2 - k_{-A} C_{\ce{C*S}} C_{\ce{O*S}}
  $$

  $$
  r_{AD} = k_A \left( P_{\ce{CO}} C_v^2 - \frac{ C_{\ce{C*S}} C_{\ce{O*S}} } { K_A }\right)
  \qquad
  K_A = \frac{k_A}{k_{-A}}
  $$

## Langmuir isotherm: Dissociative adsorption

* At equilibrium $r_{AD} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad  k_A P_{\ce{CO}} C_v^2 = k_{-A} C_{\ce{C*S}} C_{\ce{O*S}}$

* For $C_{\ce{C*S}} = C_{\ce{O*S}}: \qquad (K_A P_{\ce{CO}})^{1/2} C_v =  C_{\ce{O*S}}$

* Substituting for $C_{\ce{C*S}}$, and $C_{\ce{O*S}}$ in site balance equation

  $$ C_t = C_v + C_{\ce{C*S}} + C_{\ce{O*S}}$$

  $$ 
  C_t = C_v + (K_A P_{\ce{CO}})^{1/2} C_v + (K_A P_{\ce{CO}})^{1/2} C_v 
  = C_v (1 + 2(K_A P_{\ce{CO}})^{1/2})
  $$

* Solving for $C_v$
  $$
  C_v = \frac{C_t}{1 + 2(K_A P_{\ce{CO}})^{1/2}}
  $$

* Langmuir isotherm: 

:::{.box .center}
$$
C_{\ce{O*S}} = \frac{(K_A P_{\ce{CO}})^{1/2} C_t}{1 + 2(K_A P_{\ce{CO}})^{1/2}}
\qquad; \qquad
\frac{(P_{\ce{CO}})^{1/2}} {C_{\ce{O*S}}} 
= \frac{1}{C_t (K_A)^{1/2}} + \frac{2 (P_{\ce{CO}})^{1/2}}{C_t}
$$

## Surface reaction step: single site

* After a reactant has been adsorbed onto the surface, $\ce{A*S}$, is capable
of reacting in a number of ways to form the reaction product

* Single site mechanism 

  - The surface reaction may be a single-site mechanism in which only the site
    on which the reactant is adsorbed is involved in the reaction. 

  - An adsorbed molecule of A may isomerize (or perhaps decompose)
    directly on the site to which it is attached, for example, such as pentene isomerization

::::

## Surface reaction step: Eley-Rideal mechanism

* Reaction between adsorbed molecule and a molecule in the gas phase


* Unlike the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism it postulates reactions between
  adsorbed species and molecules directly from the gas phase.

* Examples:   
  - The reaction of propylene and benzene
  - Hydrogenation reactions: hydrogen adsorbs on the catalyst surface and
    reacts with an organic molecule directly striking from the gas phase.

$$\ce{A*S + B (g) <=> C*S}$$

$$
r_S = k_S \left( C_{\ce{A*S}} P_B -\frac{C_{\ce{C*S}}}{K_S}\right)
$$

:::
::::

## Desorption step

* Products are desorbed into the gas phase

  $$
  \ce{C*S <=> C + S}
  $$

* Rate of desorption
  
  $$
  r_{DC} = k_D \left( C_{\ce{C*S}} -\frac{P_C C_v}{K_{DC}}\right)
  $$

* The desorption of C is the reverse of the adsorption of C

  $$ r_{DC} = - r_{AD,C} $$

* The desorption equilibrium constant $K_{DC}$ is the reciprocal of the
  adsorption equilibrium constant $K_C$

  $$ K_{DC} = \frac{1}{K_C} $$

$$
r_{DC} = k_D \left[ C_{\ce{C*S}} - K_C P_C C_v \right ]
$$

## Rate limiting step

* When heterogeneous reactions are carried out at steady state, the rates of
  each of the three reaction steps in series (adsorption, surface reaction, and
  desorption) are equal to one another 

  $$ -r'_A = r_{AD} = r_S = r_D $$

* One step is usually rate-limiting or rate-controlling

  - slowest step among all.  
  - If the rate-limiting step could be sped up, the entire reaction would be
    faster
  - Although reactions involve all 7 steps, if internal and external mass
    transfer limitations are removed, only adsorption, surface reaction, or
    desorption will be rate limiting
  - Most of the times, the surface reaction step is rate limiting. 


## Derive a rate law for catalytic reaction

* Postulate catalytic mechanism, and then derive the rate law for that
  mechanism

* Assume pseudo-steady state hypothesis ($-r'_A = r_{AD} = r_S = r_D$)  

  - No accumulation of species on the surface or near interface
  - Each species adsorbed on the surface is a reactive intermediate
  - Net rate of formation of species i adsorbed on the surface is 0,
    $r_{\ce{i*S}}=0$

* Identify rate limiting step

* Steps to derive the rate law
  - Select among types of adsorption, surface reaction, and desorption
  - Write rate laws for each individual step, assuming all are reversible
  - Postulate which step is rate limiting
  - Use non-rate-limiting steps to eliminate the surface concentration terms
    that cannot be measured


::: {.callout-note appearance='simple' .bottom .fragment}

The approach in determining catalytic and heterogeneous mechanisms is usually
termed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood approach, since it is derived from ideas
proposed by Hinshelwood based on Langmuir’s principles for adsorption. The
Langmuir-Hinshelwood approach was popularized by Hougen and Watson and
occasionally includes their names (LHHW kinetics).

:::

## Evaluating a catalytic reaction mechanism

* Collect experimental data from test reactor
* Postulate and derive equation for rate law using steps in previous slide
* See if rate law is consistent with data
* If not, then try other surface mechanism (i.e., dual-site adsorption or
  Eley-Rideal) or choose a different rate-limiting step (adsorption or
  desorption)
* Repeat until the rate expression describes experimental data

It is very rare to see catalyst activity increases with the operation time

## Poisoning

* Rate of depletion of the poison from the reactant gas stream
  onto the catalyst sites, $r_{\ce{P*S}}$, is proportional to the number of
  sites that are unpoisoned ($C_{t0} - C_{\ce{P*S}}$) and the concentration of
  poison in the gas phase is $C_P$

  $$ r_{\ce{P*S}} = k_d (C_{t0} - C_{\ce{P*S}}) C_P $$

* This rate is also equal to the rate of removal of
  total active sites ($C_t$) from the surface

  $$ - \frac{dC_t}{dt} = \frac{dC_{\ce{P*S}}}{dt} = r_{\ce{P*S}}
  = k_d (C_{t0} - C_{\ce{P*S}}) C_P 
  $$

* Dividing through by $C_{t0}$ 
  $$ 
  \frac{df}{dt} = k_d (1 - f) C_P \qquad f: \text{fraction of sites that have been poisoned} 
  $$

* The fraction of sites available for adsorption $(1 - f)$ is the
  activity $a(t)$

  $$ -\frac{da}{dt} = a(t) k_d C_P $$
