## Isothermal reactor design: molar flow rates 

* In many instances it is easier to work with molar flow rates/ no. of moles
  than conversion

  - Reactors with external mass transfer (such as membrane reactors)
  - Multiple reactions in gas phase

* We *must* write a mole balance for each and every species as opposed to just
  one species 

* Usually this leads to a system of (simultaneous or) ordinary differential
  equations

* Solve the combined set of equations using ODE solver (such as
  `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`)


## Isothermal reactions in PBR: molar flow rates
### Second order reaction $\ce{aA + bB -> cC + dD}$

1. Mole balance: Write balance for each species $i = 1 \ to \ N$

   $$
   \frac{dF_i}{dW} = r'_i
   $$

2. Rate law

   $$
   -r'_A = kC_A^\alpha C_B^\beta; \qquad
   \frac{r'_A}{-a} =
   \frac{r'_B}{-b} =
   \frac{r'_C}{c} =
   \frac{r'_D}{d}
   $$

3. Stoichiometry
   $$
   C_i = \frac{C_{A0} (\Theta_i + \nu_i X)}
             {(1 + \epsilon X)}
             \left( \frac{P}{P_0} \right) 
             \left( \frac{T_0}{T} \right)
   $$

   Pressure: 
   $\frac{dP}{dW} = -\frac{\alpha}{2p} \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right) \frac{F_T}{F_{T0}}$

   Total molar flow rate: $F_T = \sum_{i=1}^N F_i$

4. Combine: 

   Collate all equations from steps 1 to 3 to yield a system of equations

5. Evaluate:
   
   Use ODE solver to solve the system of equations obtained in step 4.

## Reactor design problem

:::{.incremental}
* ![](../../../assets/images/kinetics-reactor-design-problem-volume-highight.png)


* In practice, collection and analysis of rate data is the most time consuming
  task in reactor design

* ![](../../../assets/images/kinetics-reactor-design-problem-kinetics.png)


* Data collection is done in the lab, where we can simplify mole balance,
  stoichiometry, and fluid dynamic considerations

:::

## Rate law

* Algebraic equation that relates $-r_A$ to species concentration

  $$
  -r_A = k_A(T) f(C_A, C_B, ...)
  $$

* Power law model

  - Most common general forms of the rate law

  :::{.highlight}

  $$
  -r_A = k_A C_A^\alpha C_B^\beta
  $$

  :::

* Order of reaction: the powers to which the concentrations are raised

  - The reaction is $\alpha$ order with respect to A and $\beta$ order with respect to B.
  - Overall order of reaction $n = \alpha + \beta$.

* $k_A$: Specific reaction rate
  - Depends on the temperature 

* ### Need to determine $k$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$


## Collection and analysis of rate data

:::{.incremental}

* ### Goal
  - Determine reaction order, $\alpha$, and specific reaction rate constant,
    $k$, in the rate law
  - Want ideal conditions $\rightarrow$ well-mixed (data is easiest to
    interpret) $\rightarrow$ Select a simple reactor

* ### Constant-volume batch reactor
  - For homogenous reactions 
  - Concentration vs. time measurements
  - Measurement during the unsteady-state operation

* ### Differential reactor
  - For solid-fluid reactions
  - Measurement during steady state operation
  - Product concentration is usually monitored for different feed conditions

  reaction order and rate constant. 

* $$ \ce{A + B -> C + D} $$

:::

:::{.column width=50%}

![](../../../assets/images/method-of-excess.png){width=70%}

:::

::::

* Determining reaction orders: $\alpha$, and $\beta$

  - Common simplification: One of the reactants is in excess 

  - Two separarate experiments

    - Excess B $\Rightarrow$ $C_B \gg C_A$, $C_B$ can be assumed constant.
      $\Rightarrow$ determine $\alpha$.

    - Excess A $\Rightarrow$ $C_A \gg C_B$, $C_A$ can be assumed constant.
      $\Rightarrow$ determine $\beta$.
    
* Determining $k$: Measuring rate at known concentrations of A, and B.

* Quickest method to determine if the order is 0, 1, or 2. 

  [$\Rightarrow$ Used when reaction order can be guessed or is known.]{.magenta}

#. Guess reaction order 

#. Integate the differential equation to obtain concentration as a function of
time

#. If the guessed order is correct, appropriate plot (determined from
integration) should be linear.

    Lower values indicate a better fit. RMSE is sensitive to outliers, while
    MAE provides a more robust error metric.

## Rate data from differential reactors

* For heterogeneous reactions mostly packed bed reactors (PBRs) are used.

* **Differential reactor**: The conversion of the reactants in the bed is
extremely small, as is the change in reactant concentration through the bed

* Reactant concentration through the reactor is essentially constant (i.e. the
  reactor is considered to be gradient-less)

* Can treat the mole balance like a CSTR 

* Rate of reaction determined for a
  specified number of pre-determined initial or entering reactant concentrations

*  Determine rate of reaction as a function concentration or partial pressure

* Operate isothermally
