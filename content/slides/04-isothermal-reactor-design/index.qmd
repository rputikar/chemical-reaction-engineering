1. Mole balance

   $$
   F_{A0} - F_A = \int^V r_A dV = \frac{dN_A}{dt}
   $$
   :::

2. Rate law

   If $-r_A$ is given as $f(X)$ $\rightarrow$ directly solve the design equations

3. Stoichiometry
   
   If $-r_A = g(C)$ $\rightarrow$ use stoichiometry to write $-r_A = f(X)$

4. Combine

   Gather all equations  to obtain a system of equations that must be solved. 

5. Evaluate

   The system of equation scan be solved analytically, graphically,
   numerically, or using software

## Algorithm

## Batch reactor

* Usually we are interested in calculating batch reaction time for a given $X$
  or $X$ for a given batch time

* Batch cycle time: time between batches

* Batch reaction time ($t_R$) is just one component in batch cycle time

  | | Activity || Time (h)|
  |-|-|-|-|
  |1 | Charge feed | $t_f$| 0.5 - 2|
  |2 | Heat to reaction temperature| $t_e$| 0.5 - 2|
  |3 | Reaction | $t_R$| varies |
  |4 | Empty and clean reactor | $t_c$| 1.5 - 3|
  | | Total|| (2.5h - 7h) + $t_R$|

## Activity: Batch time for second order reaction

Using the algorithm, derive equation for batch time as a function of conversion
for a second order reaction $-r_A = k_2 C_A^2$
