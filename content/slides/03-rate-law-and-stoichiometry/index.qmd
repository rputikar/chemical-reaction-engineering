* ### Rate law

  The algebraic expression for the reaction rate equation, $r_j$.

  :::{.smaller}
  $$
  -r_A = f \left[ \begin{array}{c} \text{temperature} \\ \text{dependent} \\ \text{terms} \end{array} , 
                \begin{array}{c} \text{concentration} \\ \text{dependent} \\ \text{terms} \end{array} 
         \right]
     = f(T, C)]
  $$

* How to derive an equation for $â€“r_A$ in terms of $X_A$

  - Relate all $r_j$ to $C_j$ [$\Rightarrow$ Rate law]{.magenta}

  - Relate all $C_j$ to $V$ or $\upsilon$ [$\Rightarrow$ Stoichiometry]{.magenta}

  - Relate $V$ or $\upsilon$ to $X_A$ [$\Rightarrow$ Stoichiometry]{.magenta}

  - Put together

## Basic definitions

:::{.incremental}

* **Homogeneous reaction**: involves only one phase.

* **Heterogeneous reaction**: involves more than one phase. Reaction usually
  occurs at the interface.

* **Irreversible reaction**: proceeds in only one direction. Continues until
  one of the reactants is exhausted.

* **Reversible reaction**: proceeds in either direction. Continues until
  equilibrium concentration is reached.

  :::{.callout-note appearance="simple"}

  No reaction is completely irreversible. For irreversible reactions
  equilibrium point lies far to the product side. 

  :::

* **Reaction rate**
  - **Rate laws**: are the algebraic equations that apply to a given reaction

  - **Relative rates**: how fast one species appears or disappears relative to
    the other species in a given reaction.

  - **Net rate of formation of a given species (e.g., A)**: is the sum of the
    rate of the reactions of A for all the reactions in which A is either a
    reactant or product.  

:::


##  Molecularity of reaction

:::{.incremental}

* Number of atoms, ions, or molecules involved (colliding) in a reaction step

* **Unimolecular**: One molecule colliding in one reaction step 

  - radioactive decay
    $$\ce{ _{92}U^{238} -> _{90}Th^{234} + _{2}He^{4} }$$
  - rate of disappearance of U $\Rightarrow -r_U = kC_U$

* **Bimolecular**: Two molecule colliding in one reaction step 

  - Only true bimolecular reactions are those involving collision with free
    radicals 
    $$\ce{ Br. C2H6 -> HBr + C2H5.}$$
  - $-r_{\ce{Br.}} = kC_{\ce{Br.}}C_{\ce{C2H6}}$

* **Trimolecular**: Three molecule colliding in one reaction step 

  - The probability of trimolecular reaction is almost non-existent

  - In most instances the reaction pathway follows a series of bimolecular
    reactions.

## Relative rates of reaction

:::{.incremental}
* How fast one species appears or disappears relative to the other species in a
  given reaction.

* Can be obtained from the ratio of stoichiometric coefficients

* Consider a reaction

  $$ \ce{aA + bB -> cC + dD} $$

* For every mole of A consumed $\frac{c}{a}$ moles of C appear

  :::{.smaller}
  $$
  r_C = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \text{rate of} \\ \text{formation of C}\end{array} \right] 
      = \frac{c}{a} \left[ \begin{array}{c} \text{rate of} \\ \text{disappearance of A}\end{array} \right]
      = \frac{c}{a} (-r_A)
  $$
  :::
 
  $r_C = \frac{-c}{a} r_A$ Similarly, $r_C = \frac{c}{d} r_D$

:::

:::{.fragment .highlight}

$$
\begin{array}{c} \ce{ A + \frac{b}{a} B -> \frac{c}{a} C + \frac{d}{a} D} \\
\\
\frac{-r_A}{a} = \frac{-r_B}{b} = \frac{r_C}{c} = \frac{r_D}{d} \end{array}
$$

## Rate law

* The rate of reaction depends on collision frequency of the molecules. 

* Concentration and temperature

  - Molecular collision frequency $\propto$ concentration

    $\Rightarrow$ Rate of reaction $\propto$ concentration. $-r_A = f(C_A, C_B, ...) \quad \text{for const. T}$

  - As temperature increases, collision frequency increases

    $\Rightarrow$ Rate of reaction $\propto$ temperature.  $-r_A = f([T],[C_A, C_B, ...])$

* For many reactions

  $$
  -r_A = k_A(T) f(C_A, C_B, ...)
  $$

* [Specific rate of reaction (rate constant), $k_A(T)$]{.highlight}

  - Proportionality constant in the rate equation

  - Depends on the temperature (following the Arrhenius equation), the presence
    of a catalyst, and other environmental conditions but is independent of the
    reactant concentrations.
