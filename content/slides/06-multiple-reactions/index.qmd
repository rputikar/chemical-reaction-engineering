## Introduction

* Usually, more than one reaction occurs within a chemical reactor
* Minimization of undesired side reactions that occur with the desired reaction
  contributes to the economic success of a chemical plant
* [Goal]{.magenta}: determine the reactor conditions and configuration that
  maximizes product formation
* Reactor design for multiple reactions
  - Parallel reactions
  - Series reactions
  - Independent reactions
  - More complex reactions
* Use of selectivity factor to select the proper reactor that minimizes
  unwanted side reactions

With multiple reactions, either molar flow or number of moles must be used in
setting up the balance equations (no conversion!)

1. Mole balance: Write balance for each species $i = 1 \ to \ N$

   $$
   \frac{dF_i}{dW} = r'_i
   $$

2. Rate law

   $$
   -r'_A = kC_A^\alpha C_B^\beta; \qquad
   \frac{r'_A}{-a} =
   \frac{r'_B}{-b} =
   \frac{r'_C}{c} =
   \frac{r'_D}{d}
   $$

3. Stoichiometry
   $$
   C_i = \frac{C_{A0} (\Theta_i + \nu_i X)}
             {(1 + \epsilon X)}
             \left( \frac{P}{P_0} \right) 
             \left( \frac{T_0}{T} \right)
   $$

   Pressure: 
   $\frac{dP}{dW} = -\frac{\alpha}{2p} \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right) \frac{F_T}{F_{T0}}$

   Total molar flow rate: $F_T = \sum_{i=1}^N F_i$

4. Combine: 

   Collate all equations from steps 1 to 3 to yield a system of equations

5. Evaluate:
   
   Use ODE solver to solve the system of equations obtained in step 4.

## Parallel reactions

* Competing reactions
* Reactant is consumed by two different pathways to form different products

  $$ \ce{A ->[k_1] D} \\
     \ce{A ->[k_2] U} $$

* Examples

  - Ethylene oxidation

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    \ce{C2H4 + O2} & \ce{-> C2H4O} && \text{ethylene oxide} \\
    \\
    \ce{C2H4 + O2 } & \ce{-> 2 CO2 + 2 H2O} && \text{complete combustion}
    \end{align*}
    $$

  - Fischer Tropsch synthesis

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    \ce{CO + 3 H2  } & \ce{->[k_1] CH4 + H2O} \\
    \\
    \ce{CO + 2 H2  } & \ce{->[k_2] [C_nH_{2n}]_n + H2O}
    \end{align*}
    $$

## Series reactions

* Consecutive reactions
* Reactions where reactant forms an intermediate product, which reacts further
  to form another product. 

  $$ 
  \ce{A ->[k_1] D ->[k_2] U} \qquad
  $$

* Example
  
  - Ethylene oxide (EO) + Ammonia

  $$
  \begin{align*}
     \ce{C2H4O + NH3} & \ce{-> (HOCH2CH2)NH2} && \text{(mono ethanolamine)}\\
     \\
     \ce{(HOCH2CH2)NH2 + C2H4O} & \ce{->} \underset{\textcolor{RoyalBlue}{\text{desired product}}}{\ce{(HOCH2CH2)2NH}} && \text{(di ethanolamine)} \\
     \\
     \ce{(HOCH2CH2)2NH + C2H4O} & \ce{-> (HOCH2CH2)3N} && \text{(tri ethanolamine)}
  \end{align*}
  $$

## Independent reactions

* Reactions that occur at the same time
* Neither the products nor the reactants react with themselves or one another

  $$ \ce{A ->[k_1] D} \\
     \ce{C ->[k_2] U} 
  $$


* Example: Cracking of crude oil

  Hundreds of reactions

  $$
  \begin{align*}
     \ce{C15H32} & \ce{-> C12H26 + C3H6 }\\
     \\
     \ce{C8H18} & \ce{-> C6H14 + C2H2 }
  \end{align*}
  $$

## Complex reactions

* Multiple reactions involving a combination of series, parallel, and/or independent reactions

  $$ 
  \begin{align*}
  \ce{A + B} & \ce{->[k_1] C + D} \\
     \ce{A + C } & \ce{->[k_2] E} \\ 
     \ce{E } & \ce{->[k_3] G} 
  \end{align*}
  $$

* Example: Formation of butadiene from ethanol

  $$
  \begin{align*}
     \ce{C2H5OH} & \ce{-> C2H4 + H2O }\\
     \\
     \ce{C2H5OH} & \ce{-> CH3CHO + H2 }\\
     \\
     \ce{C2H4 + CH3CHO} & \ce{-> C4H6 + H2O }
  \end{align*}
  $$


## Desired and undesired reactions

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=60%}


* Parallel reactions 
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    \ce{A} & \ce{-> D } && \leftarrow \text{desired product}\\
    \\
    \ce{A} & \ce{-> u } && \leftarrow \text{undesired byproduct}\\
  \end{align*}
  $$

* Series reactions
  $$
  \ce{A ->} \underset{\text{desired product}}{\ce{B}} \ce{-> U}
  $$

* Minimize formation of U and maximize formation of D

:::

:::{.column width=40%}

![](../../../assets/images/reactor-separator.png){width=90%}

:::

::::

:::{.callout-note appearance="simple"}

Greater the amount of U $\leftarrow$ lower production of desired product,
higher cost of separation $\leftarrow$ lower profits

:::

## Instantaneous selectivity ($S$)

* Instantaneous selectivity of D with respect to U is the ratio of the rate of
formation of D to the rate of formation of U
 
:::{style="margin-bottom: 40px;"}
:::

:::{.box .center}
$$
S_{D/U} = \frac{r_D}{r_U} = \frac{ \text{rate of formation of D}}{ \text{rate
of formation of U}}
$$
:::

:::{style="margin-bottom: 40px;"}
:::

* Gives insights in choosing reactors, operating
  conditions, and reaction schemes that will maximize profit.
* Used to guide initial selection of reactor system.
* Final selection is made after calculating the overall selelctivity for the
  reactor and operating conditions chosen. 

## Overall selectivity ($\bar{S}$)

:::{style="margin-bottom: 40px;"}
:::

:::{.box .center}
  $$
  \bar{S}_{D/U} = \frac{F_D}{F_U} = \frac{ \text{Exit molar flow rate of D}}{
  \text{Exit molar flow rate of U}} 
  $$
:::

:::{style="margin-bottom: 40px;"}
:::

* For CSTR: 
  
  $F_D = r_D V$

  $F_U = r_U V$

  $\therefore F_D/F_U = r_D/r_U = S_{D/U} = \bar{S}_{D/U}$

* For batch reactor: 

  $\bar{S}_{D/U} = N_D/N_U$

  $N_D, N_U$: Number of moles of D and U at the end of the reaction.


## Yield (Y)

### Instantaneous yield ($Y_D$)

  Ratio of the reaction rate of a given product to the reaction rate of key
  reactant A

:::{.box .center}
  $$
  Y_D = \frac{r_D}{-r_A} = \frac{ \text{Rate of formation of D}}{
  \text{Rate of consumption of A}} 
  $$
:::

:::{style="margin-bottom: 40px;"}
:::


### Overall yield ($\bar{Y}_D$)

  Ratio of moles of product formed at the end of the reaction to the number of
  moles of the key reactant A, that have been consumed. 

:::{.box .center}
  $$
  \bar{Y}_{D} = \underset{\text{For CSTR}}{\frac{F_D}{F_{A0} - F_A}} 
              = \underset{\text{For batch reactor}}{\frac{N_D}{N_{A0} - N_A}} 
  $$
:::

* Overall selectivities ($\bar{S}$) and yields ($\bar{Y}$) are important in determining profits


## Conversion ($X$)

* Gives insight into problem

* Often conflicts with selelctivity

  - Ideal world $\Rightarrow$ make as much D as possible simultaneously minimize U

  - Practical experiece $\Rightarrow$ Greater the conversion, more the undesired product

* [Not used in solving multiple reaction problems, but calculated later for analysis]{.highlight}

* For species A
  $$
  X_A = \underset{\text{Flow system}}{\frac{F_{A0} - F_A}{F_{A0}}} \qquad
  X_A = \underset{\text{Batch system}}{\frac{N_{A0} - N_A}{N_{A0}}}
  $$

* For species B
  $$
  X_B = \underset{\text{Flow system}}{\frac{F_{B0} - F_B}{F_{B0}}} \qquad
  X_B = \underset{\text{Batch system}}{\frac{N_{B0} - N_B}{N_{B0}}}
  $$

1. Number each and every reaction separately. 

2. Mole balance on each and every species.

   $$
   F_{j0} - F_j + \int^V r_j dV = \frac{dN_j}{dt}
   $$
 
3. For every reaction write rate law. Calculate the net rate of reaction and
   relative rates

   For component $j$: $r_j = \sum_{i=1}^N r_{i,j}$

4. Stoichiometry

5. Combine: 

   Collate all equations from steps 2 to 4 to yield a system of equations

5. Evaluate:
   
   Use ODE solver to solve the system of equations obtained in step 4.

* Can be applied to parallel, series, independent, and complex reactions.

* For liquid systems concentration is usually preferred variable for mole
balance.

## Parallel reactions: Selectivity

* Consider two competing reactions

  $$ 
  \begin{align*}  
  \ce{A -> D}  & \text{(desired)} \qquad  && r_D = k_D C_A^{\alpha_1}\\
  \\
  \ce{A -> U}  & \text{(undesired)} \qquad && r_U = k_U C_A^{\alpha_2}
  \end{align*}
  $$


* Net rate of disappearance of A

  $$ 
  -r_A = r_D + r_U=  k_D C_A^{\alpha_1} + k_U C_A^{\alpha_2}
  $$

:::{style="margin-bottom: 40px;"}

$$
S_{D/U} = \frac{r_D}{r_U} = \frac{k_D}{k_U} C_A^{\alpha_1 - \alpha_2}
$$

  $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$ are positive orders

## Case 1: $\alpha_1 > \alpha_2$

::::{.columns .center}

:::{.column width=50%}

* $\alpha_1 - \alpha_2  = a$

* $S_{D/U} = \frac{k_D}{k_U} C_A^{a}$

* To maximize selectivity we wan to carry out the reaction in a manner that
  will keep $C_A$ as high as possible during the reaction. 

* [Use PFR or batch reactor]{.highlight}

* Gas phase: Use high pressure, run without inerts
* Liquid phase: minimize diluent

  will keep $C_A$ as low as possible during the reaction. 

* [Use CSTR or dilute feed stream]{.highlight}

## Effect of temperature

* Need information on activation energy

* Sensitivity to temperature for fixed concentrations ($C_A^a$ is constant)

:::{.box .center}
$$
S_{D/U} \approx \frac{k_D}{k_U} = \frac{A_D}{A_U} e^{-[(E_D - E_U)/RT]}
$$
:::

* $E_D > E_U$
  
  - $k_D$ increases more rapidly than $k_U$ with increase in temperature
  - Perform the reaction at highest possible temperature

* $E_D < E_U$

  - $k_U$ increases more rapidly than $k_D$ with increase in temperature
  - Reaction should be carried out at lower temperature to maximize $S_{D/U}$

  - The temperature should not be very low as it might affect reaction extent.
    Reaction may not proceed at low temperature. 


## Two simultaneous reactions and two reactants

* Consider two competing parallel reactions

  $$ 
  \begin{align*}  
  \ce{A + B -> D}  & \text{(desired)} \qquad  && r_D = k_D C_A^{\alpha_1} C_B^{\beta_1}\\
  \\
  \ce{A + B -> U}  & \text{(undesired)} \qquad && r_U = k_U C_A^{\alpha_2} C_B^{\beta_2}
  \end{align*}
  $$


* Net rate of disappearance of A

  $$ 
  -r_A = r_D + r_U=  k_D C_A^{\alpha_1} C_B^{\beta_1} + k_U C_A^{\alpha_2} C_B^{\beta_2}
  $$

* Selectivity

:::{.box .center}
$$
S_{D/U} = \frac{r_D}{r_U} = \frac{k_D}{k_U} C_A^{\alpha_1 - \alpha_2} C_B^{\beta_1 - \beta_2}
$$
:::

* Selectivity depends on the orders $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$ 
* Several reactor combinations exist

  - Batch time (real time)
  - Space time (continuous reactor)

* Consider: $\ce{A ->[k_1] B ->[k_2] C}$. 
  
  B is the desired product

* If $k_1 \ll k_2$: First reaction is slow
  - Extremely difficult to produce significant amount of B. 

* If $k_1 \gg k_2$: First reaction is fast
  - Large yield of B can be achieved.

If reaction is allowed to proceed for a long time, desired product B will be converted to undesired product C. 

Accuracy of prediction for time required to carry out the reaction is vital.

:::{.column width=50%}

* Consider the reaction 

  $\ce{A ->[k_1] B ->[k_2] C}$. 
  
  B is the desired product, C is waste product. 

* We are interested in 
  - Concentration vs. time profile
  - Maximum concentration of B
  - Quench time (time to stop when $C_B$ is maximum)
  - Overall selectivity and yield. 

* Number of reactions

  The series reaction can be written as two reactions

  $\ce{A -> B}; -r_{1A} = k_1 C_A$. 

  $\ce{B -> C}; -r_{2B} = k_2 C_B$.
