## Outline 

We tried to implement a different teaching method this semester in the reaction
engineering unit. The method includes teaching through in-class,
problem-solving activities, using programming tools for solving simultaneous
ODEs, open-book portfolio assessments, etc. Our attempt is to provide students
interactive learning and project or problem-based learning and assess them on
their understanding of concept.   

The session will focus on sharing the changes we made, teaching strategies, and
assessment methods. We like to share the outcomes of these changes, including
student engagement, comprehension levels, challenges, and overall performance
in the unit. We also want to gather feedback from you, exchange insights, and
discuss potential improvements or further innovations that could be integrated
into future courses. 

The session will also be an excellent opportunity to reflect on best practices,
pedagogical challenges, and the impact of novel approaches on student learning
outcomes in the engineering discipline.

* Correctly identifies species, applies generalized mole balance to the species

* Correctly identifies batch/ semi-batch nature of some of the species and
develops appropriate balance equations

* Correctly identifies calculation of $\ln\left(\frac{C_{\ce{N2O5}}}{C_{\ce{N2O5},0}}\right)$

* Correctly calculates value for $k$ along with correct units.

* Uses correct formula for $\tau_m$. Value of $\tau_m$ essentially correct (13.9 min Vs. 15 min) 
  -- It uses integral using trapezoidal rule

* Formulas used for CSTR, and PFR not correct (in this context)

* Predicts higher conversion for CSTR compared to PFR

* Did not get the question. So the first part is not answered. 

* However, solution is correct for calculation of $E$, $k$, and $K$. 

* Uses much advanced curve fitting (`scipy.optimize.curve_fit`) for calculations.

![](./cre_question_5_statement.png){width=90%}

* Cites mostly correct formulas 

* Some individual quantities (such as $\Delta H_{rxn}$) correctly calculated, others not (e.g. $\Sigma C_p$)

* Does not calculate $\Delta T$ accurately

* Thus volume calculation is wrong. The procedure is essentially correct.

## Motivation

* How do we adapt our teaching in Post ChatGPT world?

* Are we creating (training) inferior GPT models?

* How do we provide insight into the subject without making it too theoretical? 

* How do we train students on real world problems?


## Implementation vision

* Apprenticeship model

  - Students work to hone their craft under guidance of a master craftsman.

* Minimum viable concept (MVC) 

  - What are the key core concepts that the student **must** master in order to understand the subject?

* Reinforcing the MVCs using practical problems

* Work on complex problems by facilitating solutions using computers. 

* Instant gratification

  - Students can see progress they are making in the unit (almost) real time.  

  - Interactive project or problem-based learning

* Systems thinking

  - How does the subject fit in grand scheme of things?

  - How can I use this knowledge somewhere else?

* Continuous assessment on understanding of concepts


## Implementation plan

* All activities designed for in-person classes

* No distinction between lectures/ workshops

  - Fluid format 
  
* Comprehensive lecture material
  
  - Lecture slides

  - Notes

  - In class activities

  - Prelab modules and worksheets

  - Workshop problems 

  - Wide use of computer aided solutions

* Assessments

  - No closed book exams
    - Limits the kind of problems/ questions you can set
    - Students study for the exams (previous papers/ repeat workshop/ in-class
      problems etc) and not to understand the subject. 

  - A mix of continuous assessment (portfolio), labwork, and final project

## Changes made to the unit

* Syllabus
  
  - Mostly unchanged
  - Removed portions of unit material that focused on archaic methods of solution (e.g. graphical differentiation)
  - Focus on numerical solution and not analytical solution

* Assessments

## Assessments

* Experiment

  - 30% instead of 15%
  - Change in marking rubric
  - Pre-experiment memo (individual activity): Make sure the student
    understands the experiment and has independently completed HSRA 
  - Conducting experiments: Each student marked by the demonstrators for their
    conduct during lab
  - Final report (group submission)

* Portfolio

  - A set of 8 individual portfolios (mix of take home and in class), best 6 considered. 
  - Students work on the same problem and tackle different (reaction engineering) aspects in each portfolio
  - All 8 tasks are linked to each other
  - Students can appreciate chemical reactor design with varying degrees of complexity. 

## Portfolio

## Assessments

* Project

  - Group activity
  
  - Real life highly relevant problem

  - Highly open ended

* This year's project

  - Small scale skid mounted hydrogen production from city gas by reforming

  - Significant commercial activity in this area in Korea and Japan
