# Modeling of packed-bed reactor for the water-gas shift reaction

## Introduction

Hydrogen is rapidly emerging as a key player in the global shift toward clean
energy. 

The primary production route is through methane reforming, which includes three
main processes: steam reforming, autothermal reforming, and partial oxidation.
Steam reforming is endothermic (requires heat), while partial oxidation is
exothermic (releases heat). These reactions generate hydrogen along with carbon
monoxide (CO), which must be removed for applications such as fuel cells, where
CO levels must be below 10 ppm due to its poisoning effect on the
electrocatalyst. 

The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is a key step in hydrogen production
processes, particularly for lowering carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in
reformate streams to levels suitable for fuel cell applications. Due to its
exothermic nature and equilibrium-limited conversion, the WGS reaction is
typically conducted in two stages: a high-temperature (HT) stage using Fe-based
catalysts and a low-temperature (LT) stage using Cu-based catalysts. Among
low-temperature catalysts, commercial CuO/ZnO/Al₂O₃ formulations have
demonstrated superior performance in terms of CO conversion and operational
stability.

To effectively utilize this catalyst in practical systems, there is a growing
need for accurate modeling of packed-bed reactors used for the WGS reaction.
These reactors are increasingly considered for compact, small-scale hydrogen
generation units that can integrate with membrane reactors for producing
high-purity H₂. Existing studies have provided kinetic parameters for the
CuO/ZnO/Al₂O₃ catalyst based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Redox models,
validated through experimental data over a range of temperatures (150–300 °C).
Accurate reactor modeling is essential for designing and optimizing such
systems, especially when targeting high CO conversion and integration with
downstream purification units.

## Problem description

In this project, your team has been assigned the task of developing a reaction
engineering model for a fixed-bed packed-bed reactor (PBR) employing a
CuO/ZnO/Al₂O₃ catalyst for the low-temperature WGS reaction. The model will use
previously reported kinetic expressions to simulate reactor behavior and will
be validated against available experimental data. In addition, the study will
perform systematic parametric analyses to investigate the effects of key
process variables—including temperature, pressure, and feed gas composition—on
reactor performance. The goal is to develop a predictive model that captures
the core reaction behavior and supports the design and operation of WGS
reactors in hydrogen production systems.

The base references for this project are (@manrique2012ijcre, @zhou2023joec)

### Reaction Engineering Aspects of the Water-Gas Shift Reaction  

Prepare a comprehensive review (4-5 pages) on the reaction engineering
fundamentals of the Water-Gas Shift (WGS) reaction. Cover key areas such as the
industrial relevance of the WGS reaction, its role in hydrogen production, the
catalytic systems used (including high-temperature iron-based and
low-temperature copper-based catalysts), and mechanistic insights such as
Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Redox pathways. Discuss reactor configurations (e.g.,
adiabatic vs. isothermal packed beds, membrane reactors), typical operating
conditions, and challenges such as CO poisoning in downstream fuel cells.
Highlight recent advances in catalyst development and reactor miniaturization
for small-scale H₂ generation. Use the provided reference (@manrique2012ijcre,
@zhou2023joec) as a starting point to support discussions on kinetic models and
the rationale behind the choice of catalyst and reactor type for this study.


### Modeling of a Packed-Bed Reactor for the WGS Reaction

Develop a one-dimensional isothermal reaction engineering model of a packed-bed
reactor (PBR) for the low-temperature WGS reaction using the CuO/ZnO/Al₂O₃
catalyst. Incorporate kinetic expressions as reported by @mendes2010iecr
applying the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model at temperatures below 215 °C and a
Redox mechanism above that threshold. Use the modeling approach described by
@manrique2012ijcre to formulate mass balance equations assuming
ideal packed bed reactor. Simulate species concentration profiles
and CO conversion using appropriate computational tool (such as python or
similar tools). Validate model predictions with experimental data from
literature. State all assumptions clearly, justify them with literature, and
tabulate physical and kinetic parameters used. 

### Parametric Analysis of Process Variables

Conduct a detailed parametric study to evaluate the influence of key process
variables such as temperature, pressure, feed composition (CO and H₂O content),
and flow rate on reactor performance. Use conditions and data from
@manrique2012ijcre. Use your engineering judgment, literature sources, etc. for
any missing data. Use the validated reactor model to simulate changes in CO
conversion and hydrogen yield under different operating scenarios. Analyze
trends in the results with reference to thermodynamic limitations and kinetic
control. Compare trends with those reported in @manrique2012ijcre, including
how conversion responds to increased space time or pressure. Conclude this
section with a discussion on optimal operating conditions for maximizing
hydrogen production. Include brief notes on implications for reactor control
and safety (e.g., sensitivity to temperature changes and implications for
catalyst stability).

The project is deliberately set to be open‐ended. You are expected to do some
self‐directed study of material outside of what has been covered in the unit.
