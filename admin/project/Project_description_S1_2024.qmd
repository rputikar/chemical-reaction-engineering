# Compact steam methane reformer for on-site hydrogen supply

## Introduction

Hydrogen is rapidly emerging as a key player in the global shift toward clean
energy. Hydrogen fueling stations are critical to this transition, especially
as the demand for compact and efficient fueling solutions grows alongside the
rise in fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). These stations represent a significant
advancement in refueling infrastructure, offering fast, high-density energy
solutions compatible with the increasing pace of modern transportation. While
the industry is still evolving and grappling with challenges related to
innovation and technology scaling, the development of more compact hydrogen
fueling options could significantly accelerate the adoption of hydrogen as a
mainstream energy source and drive further advancements in sustainable
transport.

On-site hydrogen production through steam-methane reforming (SMR) from city gas
or natural gas is believed to be a cost-effective way for hydrogen-based
infrastructure due to high cost of hydrogen transportation (@zhang2022ijohe). 

Compact hydrogen production systems on-site typically involve a series of
processes: steam-methane reforming (SMR), water-gas shift (WGS), and pressure
swing adsorption (PSA). If the system uses urban gas as a feedstock, it
necessitates a desulfurization step to lower sulfur content to ppm levels. This
precaution helps to prevent potential detrimental impacts on the catalysts used
in both the reforming and shift reactions and maintains the integrity of the
hydrogen production process. A typical process is shown in @fig-1.

Steam methane reforming occurs in reactors that are actually tubular furnaces
(@worstell2014). A typical steam methane reformer preheats the gas feed in a
convection furnace box, then injects the hot gas into vertical tubes placed in
a radiation furnace box. The vertical tubes contain a nickel impregnated
solid-supported catalyst (@zhang2021raser). The catalyst-filled tubes are
designed for a specified heat flux along the tube (@karpilov2023tsaep).

## Problem description

In this project, your team has been assigned the task of designing a fixed bed
SMR reactor capable of generating 30 $Nm^3/h$ of hydrogen using city gas. 

Your team will research on the SMR technology, design the SMR reactor, and
explore strategies for control and optimization of the reactor. 

### A short note on reactors used for SMR

Based on literature survey, prepare a note on reaction engineering aspects of
steam methane reforming. The references provided at the end may be used as a
starting point for preparing such a note.

### Design of SMR reactor

Consider all the major reactions occuring within the SMR process. Detailed
kinetics of the reactions occuring is given by @hou2001cej. 
Using appropriate assumptions, follow the reaction engineering algorithm to
develop (mass and energy) balance equations for both the reforming section and
furnace section[^1]. Use literature to obtain all the data required for
completing your design. 

[^1]: Essentially, you are designing two reactors. These two reactors have
different reactions taking place within them. You may also choose to model
these two reactors as two different types (e.g. the reformer as a PBR, and the
furnace as a CSTR)

Once your design is finalized, using the data you obtain from your simulations,
explore possibilities for optimization and comment on safety, and control of
the reactor. 

The project is deliberately set to be open‐ended. You are expected to do some
self‐directed study of material outside of what has been covered in the unit. 

## Report

Prepare a report consisting of the following:

1. Reaction engineering aspects of steam methane reforming \hfill (20 marks)

## Submission

The project is conducted in a group of four. 
You are free to choose your group.
Please notify the instructors of your groups as soon as you form them.
If you cannot find a group, please get in touch with your instructor at the earliest.
You will need to submit all the files created electronically on blackboard (Moodle for Miri students).
There should be one submission per group. 
Please follow the instructions given below carefully for preparing the files for submission.
Failure to follow these instructions may result in us not being able to assess the files.

You will be uploading two files.

1.  Report (pdf file containing the report).
    You need to name the file as STUDENTID_CHEN3010_project_report.pdf (or )
    STUDENTID_CHEN5040_project_report.pdf (Replace STUDENTID with your Student
    ID). You need to make only one submission per group.

2.  Create a zip file named STUDENTID_CHEN3010_project_Supporting_files.zip.
    The zip file should contain a) All supporting files for design, modeling,
    and simulation activities (excel, python, ...) presented in the PDF report
    file. You may upload the supporting file to a cloud storage of your preference
    and share a link with us.
